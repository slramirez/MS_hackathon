AFGHANISTAN
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
Head of state and government: Muhammad Ashraf
Ghani Ahmadzai (replaced Hamid Karzai in
September)
There was growing insecurity throughout
the country in expectation of the planned
withdrawal of 86,000 foreign troops in
December, as the mandate of NATO’s
International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) ended. The USA committed its
troops to remain engaged in combat until
the end of 2015. The UN Assistance
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported
that casualties among civilians not involved
in hostilities in Afghanistan were at an
all-time high. The Taliban and other armed
insurgent groups were responsible for more
than 74% of civilian casualties, with 9%
attributed to pro-government forces. A
further 12% of casualties occurred during
ground engagement between pro-Afghan
government and Taliban insurgents and
could not be attributed to any group. The
remaining were as a result of the conflict.
A lack of accountability in cases where
civilians were killed or otherwise harmed
unlawfully left many victims and their
families without access to justice and
reparation. During the year, the Parliament
and the Ministry of Justice approved or
amended a number of laws, including the
Criminal Procedure Code, which barred
family members of both victims and
perpetrators of crimes from testifying. Since
most gender-based violence was reported
as happening within the family, this would
have made successful prosecutions in
such cases nearly impossible. The law was
approved by both houses of parliament but
was not signed and was rejected by then
President Karzai following an outcry from
national and international human rights
organizations.

BACKGROUND
With no clear winner in the April presidential
election and a June run-off marred by
accusations of massive and systematic
fraud against both candidates, electoral
deadlock ensued for five months. Following
long negotiations and interventions by US
Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Special
Representative in Afghanistan Jan Kubis, the
two front runners agreed to form the country’s
first unity government as election results were
announced on 22 September. Ashraf Ghani
was sworn in as President on 29 September,
with rival candidate Abdullah Abdullah
serving as chief executive, a role similar to
that of a prime minister. By the end of 2014,
the new cabinet had yet to be announced,
three months after President Ghani was sworn
into office.
In June, in response to international
pressure to curb the financing of terrorism
within Afghanistan’s jurisdiction, a bill against
money laundering was approved by both
houses of the Afghan Parliament and signed
into law by then President Karzai.
On 30 September, President Ghani signed
the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with
the USA and the Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) with NATO, allowing 9,800 US and
2,000 additional NATO troops to remain in
Afghanistan beyond the end of formal combat
operations in December. Their role will largely
be to provide training and mentoring to
Afghan government forces.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Between 1 January and 30 June, the number
of casualties among civilians not involved in
hostilities reached 4,853, of which more than
70% were caused by the Taliban and other
armed insurgent groups. This figure marked
a doubling since 2009 and an increase of
24% on the same period in 2013. Of these,
1,564 deaths were recorded and 3,289
people injured.
UNAMA said that improvised explosive
devices and suicide attacks claimed the
highest number of casualties. Ground
Amnesty International Report 2014/15engagements caused two out of every five
civilian casualties, with 474 killed and 1,427
injured. This represented 39% of all civilian
casualties, an increase of 89% from 2013.
The Taliban and other armed insurgent
groups frequently attacked targets within
easy reach, causing large numbers of civilian
casualties. Child casualties and women
casualties both increased by 24% from 2013,
accounting for 29% of all recorded casualties
in the first half of 2014.
Between January and August 2014 the
NGO Safety Organization in Afghanistan
recorded 153 attacks on aid workers,
resulting in 34 people killed and 33 injured.
The government attributed the majority
of these attacks to gunmen belonging to
insurgent groups, including the Taliban.
VIOLATIONS BY INTERNATIONAL AND
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT FORCES
ISAF and NATO forces continued to launch
night raids and aerial and ground attacks,
claiming dozens of civilian lives, despite
completing the handover of responsibility
for security to the Afghan National Security
Forces (ANSF) in June 2013. UNAMA said
that 9% of the total civilian casualties were
caused by pro-government forces (8% to
ANSF and 1% to ISAF/NATO forces) with
ground combat and crossfire accounting
for the majority of deaths. The total number
of civilians killed by pro-government forces
during the first six months of 2014 fell
from 302 to 158, mostly due to reduced
aerial military operations. The ANSF were
responsible for greater civilian casualties due
to their full involvement in military operations
and ground engagement.
There were significant failures of
accountability for civilian deaths, including a
lack of transparent investigations and a lack
of justice for the victims and their families. 1
In May, the English High Court ruled as
unlawful the detention policy adopted by
UK forces in Afghanistan after reviewing the
case of Serdar Mohammed, held since 2010.
The Court found that his detention beyond
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
the 96 hours permitted had been arbitrary,
in violation of the European Convention on
Human Rights. Following the ruling, the
Afghan government ordered the UK to hand
over 23 detainees held in two UK-run facilities
in Helmand.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights
Commission (AIHRC) registered 4,154 cases
of violence against women in the first half of
the year alone, a 25% increase on the same
period in 2013. There was an increase in
reported crimes against women and girls,
but it was not clear whether this was due to
an increase in violence or in awareness and
access to complaint mechanisms for women.
A 2013 UN report found that the Law on the
Elimination of Violence Against Women was
applied in only 17% of all reported cases of
violence against women in Afghanistan.
In a move seen as positive by women’s
and human rights groups, former President
Karzai refused to sign into law the Criminal
Procedure Code passed by the Afghan
Parliament, which would have prohibited
relatives of the accused from testifying in
criminal cases. Since most gender-based
violence was reported as happening within
the family, this would have made successful
prosecutions much more difficult to achieve
and would have denied justice to victims
of rape and domestic violence, as well as
those subjected to underage and forced
marriages. On the other hand, the reduction
in the quota of women’s seats in provincial
councils, and the absence of women in
the peace negotiation process with the
Taliban, constituted backward steps for
women’s rights.
According to the Afghan Ministry of Public
Health, there were 4,466 cases of self-
poisoning and 2,301 cases of self-immolation
by women during the year, resulting in the
deaths of 166 women. Gender-based violence
was reported as the primary cause of these
acts of self-harm, followed by conflict-related
trauma and displacement.
51On 30 April a cleric was arrested for tying
up and raping one of his Qur’an pupils, a
10-year-old girl, in Kunduz province. 2
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND
DETENTIONS, AND TORTURE
AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Arbitrary arrests and detentions, including
some incommunicado detention, continued
under the intelligence service, the National
Directorate of Security (NDS) and the police.
Suspects were routinely denied due process,
including being denied access to a lawyer
or to their families. Allegations continued
of violations by NDS personnel, including
torture and other ill-treatment and enforced
disappearances.
At least 50 non-Afghan prisoners remained
in US custody in Parwan detention facility
(formerly known as Bagram) at the end of the
year. Some were believed to have been held
since 2002. Their identities and any possible
charges against them remained undisclosed,
as did details of their legal representation and
access to medical care.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
– JOURNALISTS
The government failed to investigate
adequately and prosecute perpetrators
of attacks on journalists and other media
workers who were peacefully exercising their
right to freedom of expression.
There was a reported 50% rise in the
number of journalists killed in 2014 and
a 60% increase in the number of attacks
in the first half of the year, compared with
2013 figures.
Journalists were arrested, threatened,
beaten or killed in apparently politically
motivated attacks by government workers,
international forces, insurgent groups and
supporters of election candidates. According
to Afghan media watchdog Nai, 20 journalists
were attacked and seven killed. Journalists
covering the presidential election were
particularly at risk.

REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY
DISPLACED PEOPLE
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, estimated
that Afghans continued to account for the
highest number of refugees in the world.
Neighbouring Iran and Pakistan hosted
2.7 million registered Afghan refugees.
In March, UNHCR documented 659,961
Afghans who were internally displaced due to
armed conflict, deterioration of security and
natural disasters.
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Refugees and
Repatriation launched the landmark National
Internally Displaced People (IDP) Policy on
11 February 2014, providing a legal definition
for displaced people and establishing the
government’s primary responsibilities in
providing emergency assistance, long-term
support and protection. There were concerns
that displacement could increase, however,
following the security transition scheduled for
the end of 2014 as local insurgents fought to
occupy territory previously under the control
of international forces.
Displaced people continued to migrate
to larger cities such as Kabul, Herat and
Mazar-e-Sharif. Inadequate makeshift
shelters, overcrowding and poor hygiene,
combined with harsh weather conditions, led
to an increase in communicable and chronic
diseases such as malaria and hepatitis.
Efforts to eradicate the polio virus through
vaccination programmes were impeded
by opposition armed groups, including the
Taliban, and cases continued to be reported.
DEATH PENALTY
Afghanistan continued to apply the death
penalty, often after unfair trials.
On 8 October, six men were executed in
Kabul Pul-e-Charkhi prison, less than two
weeks after President Ghani’s inauguration.
Five had been convicted in connection with
the gang-rape of four women in Paghman
district. A sixth man had been convicted in
a separate case of a series of kidnappings,
murders and armed robberies. On 28
September, then President Karzai signed
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the death warrants for the six men. The trial
proceedings of five men were considered
unfair and controversial, marred by public
and political pressure on the courts to hand
down a tough sentence while the accused
claimed to have confessed following torture
by police in detention.
President Ghani ordered a review of nearly
400 death row cases.

ALBANIA
Republic of Albania
Head of state: Bujar Nishani
Head of government: Edi Rama
Domestic violence remained widespread
and survivors rarely received justice.
Impunity for cases of torture and
other ill-treatment continued. Access
to habitable and affordable housing
for people living in poverty, including
Roma, remained very limited, despite
government pledges. A former barracks
designated as temporary accommodation
for victims of forced eviction did not meet
international standards.
BACKGROUND
In June, the EU Council of Ministers approved
EU candidate status for Albania, conditional
on further judicial reform, combating
corruption and organized crime and ensuring
the protection of human rights, including the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
UNLAWFUL KILLINGS
Prosecutors reviewed the case of Aleks
Nika, a demonstrator who died after being
shot during anti-government demonstrations
in January 2011 in the capital Tirana. In
May, police officers who allegedly ill-treated
some demonstrators during and after the
protests were questioned. In July, the state
prosecutor filed charges against the former
General Director of Police and his deputy for
failing to arrest six Republican Guard officers
suspected of shooting at the demonstrators.
HOUSING RIGHTS
The Ministry of Urban Development and
Tourism and the National Housing Authority
proposed to increase the stock of social
housing and access for those in inadequate
housing. In February, the Ministry announced
a new housing strategy to include Roma
and Egyptians, to promote the legalization
of informal settlements, and to improve
access to water and sanitation. However, little
progress was made.
In March 2014, a former barracks in
the Shishtufinë area of Tirana was formally
designated as the National Emergency
Transition Centre for victims of forced
evictions. Over 50 Roma families evicted
from Rruga e Kavajes in Tirana had been
resettled in Shishtufinë in October 2013.
Conditions at the centre – which was located
far from sources of employment and basic
53services – were inadequate and did not meet
international standards for adequate housing.
On International Roma Day in April, some
of the 100 Roma families at risk of eviction
from Selita in Tirana demonstrated to demand
alternative housing. The government rejected
a proposed amendment to the law on the
legalization of illegal construction in May,
requested in a petition signed by 6,000 Roma
and Egyptians which called for procedural
protections against forced eviction and
adequate alternative accommodation.
In July the UN Human Rights
Committee issued an interim protection
measure suspending the demolition of
seven Roma families’ houses in Elbasan
pending the hearing of their complaint and
compensation claim.
The government failed to guarantee the
legal right of homeless registered orphans up
to the age of 30 to priority access to social
housing. In May, on national Orphans Day,
orphans demonstrated calling for education
and housing, and describing the financial
assistance provided by the state as derisory.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Impunity generally persisted for allegations of
ill-treatment by law enforcement officers. In
May, Parliament introduced a new Internal
Issues and Complaints Service to combat
police corruption and human rights violations.
In August the Head of the Public Order sector
of the State Police in Kukës was charged with
abuse of office and unlawful deprivation of
liberty, for the ill-treatment of a detainee.
Former political prisoners organized hunger
strikes in protest against the government’s
failure to fairly distribute compensation
for their imprisonment by the communist
government between 1944 and 1991, when
thousands were imprisoned or sent to labour
camps and subjected to torture and other
ill-treatment.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
In June the High Council of Justice published
a review of domestic violence cases in 38
54
courts, and recommended changes to the law
and court practice. They found that criminal
proceedings were slow and that courts
violated procedural deadlines for reviewing
protection orders and issuing decisions.
Some 3,094 incidents of domestic violence
were reported to the police by the end of
September, with women accounting for the
majority of the victims. Just over a third
(1,292) of these reports resulted in criminal
proceedings.
By the end of September, 1,882
women had sought protection orders in
civil proceedings; however, in the Tirana
District Court, for example, more than two-
thirds of applications for protection orders
were withdrawn or discontinued. Where
protection orders were issued they were often
not enforced.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In response to EU pressure, Albania
developed a new border management
strategy. Over 500 undocumented migrants
and refugees, including Syrians, were
detained between January and June. Others
were returned to Greece without access to an
asylum process. By the end of September,
over 12,000 Albanians had applied for asylum
in EU member states, on grounds including
domestic violence and discrimination against
LGBTI people and Roma.
ALGERIA
People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria
Head of state: Abdelaziz Bouteflika
Head of government: Abdelmalek Sellal
The authorities restricted freedoms of
expression, association and peaceful
assembly, particularly in the run-up to
April’s presidential election, dispersing
demonstrations and harassing activists.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Women faced discrimination in law and
practice and remained inadequately
protected against violence, despite proposed
legislative reforms. Impunity prevailed for
perpetrators of gross human rights abuses
during the 1990s and acts of torture
committed in subsequent years. Irregular
migrants faced discrimination, abuse and
arbitrary expulsion. Armed groups carried
out lethal attacks. Death sentences were
imposed; no executions were carried out. killed the leader of Jund al-Khalifa and two of
his associates.
Algeria became a member of the UN
Human Rights Council in January but the
government continued to fail to agree to
long-requested visits by key UN bodies
and experts, including those concerned
with torture, counter-terrorism, enforced
disappearances and the right to freedom of
association. The authorities did not grant visas
to Amnesty International staff to visit Algeria. 1
BACKGROUND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
2014 saw continued social unrest caused
by tensions between the Mozabite and Arab
communities in the city of Ghardaia. There
were demonstrations against unemployment,
poverty and corruption in the oil and gas-
rich south, as well as protests focused on
President Bouteflika’s decision to run for
re-election in April.
Following the election, the government
opened consultations on proposed revisions
to the Constitution but some political parties
boycotted these consultations and most
independent civil society organizations were
excluded. At the end of the year the process
appeared to have stalled.
There were new clashes between the
security forces and armed groups, notably
Al Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM),
mostly in southern and eastern Algeria.
Foreign governments increased their security
co-operation with Algeria following the attack
in January 2013 by an armed group at the
In Amenas gas extraction complex, in which
dozens were killed and hundreds taken
hostage, including foreign civilian workers. In
September, an armed group calling itself Jund
al-Khalifa (Soldiers of the Caliphate) abducted
a French national in the Tizi-Ouzou region,
an area where people had previously been
kidnapped for ransom, and published a video
on the internet showing him beheaded. His
killing was in apparent reprisal for France’s
participation in a US-led alliance fighting
the Islamic State armed group in Iraq. In
December, the government said its forces had Journalists and government critics faced
restrictions and judicial harassment by the
authorities. On 12 March, the security forces
closed down Al-Atlas TV, a private television
station that had reported on anti-government
protests and given airtime to a number of
government critics. The authorities accused
Al-Atlas TV of broadcasting without a licence. 2
On 10 June, a court sentenced Youcef
Ouled Dada to two years’ imprisonment and
a fine for posting a video on the internet
showing police officers stealing from a
shop during clashes in Ghardaia. The court
convicted him of publishing photos and
videos against the national interest and
insulting a state institution. His sentence was
confirmed on appeal.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
The authorities maintained a ban on all
demonstrations in the capital Algiers although
the security forces allowed some to go ahead
without interference. In other cases, the
police forcibly dispersed demonstrators,
especially those from the Barakat (Enough)
movement protesting against the President’s
decision to stand for re-election for a fourth
term of office in April, and arrested some
demonstrators, often releasing them after a
few hours in custody. 3 Police also forcibly
dispersed protests in other cities.
On 20 April, police used excessive force to
disperse demonstrators in Tizi-Ouzou city who
were commemorating the violent repression
of protesters in 2001 in the Kabylia region.
55Witnesses reported that police beat unarmed
protesters and fired plastic bullets, one of
which hit Lounis Aliouat, blinding him in one
eye. The authorities said they had suspended
five police officers pending an investigation
into the beatings but they did not disclose the
outcome of the investigation.
In May, a court imposed suspended
six-month sentences on Mohand Kadi, a
student, and Tunisian national Moez Benncir
on charges of “participating in a non-armed
gathering that may disturb public order”.
Police had arrested both men on 16 April
near a Barakat movement demonstration in
Algiers, although both denied participating in
it. 4 Mohand Kadi’s sentence was confirmed
on appeal.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
In January, the deadline for registering
existing associations under Law 12-06
expired. The law imposed wide-ranging and
arbitrary restrictions on associations, including
NGOs and civil society organizations,
and penalties of imprisonment for up to
six months plus a fine for membership
of unregistered, suspended or dissolved
associations. While some associations were
able to register, others remained in legal limbo
as they waited for the authorities’ response to
their registration application.
Amnesty International Algeria was one of
a number of independent NGOs to file its
registration application in accordance with the
procedures set out in Law 12-06 but received
no acknowledgement or other response from
the authorities, despite repeated requests.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
The authorities took some steps to improve
women’s rights. On 1 February, the adoption
of Decree 14-26 provided for the first time for
financial compensation to be paid by state
authorities to women raped by members of
armed groups during the internal conflict
of the 1990s. At the end of the year it was
unclear how many women had received
compensation under Decree 14-26.
56
In June, the government proposed new
legislation to criminalize physical violence
against a spouse and indecent assaults on
women when they are carried out in public.
The proposed legislation would also make it
a punishable offence to abandon a spouse
or to use coercion or intimidation to obtain a
spouse’s financial resources. The proposed
law establishing a state fund to assist divorced
women with custody of their children whose
former husbands failed to pay them alimony
was adopted by Parliament on 26 November.
At the end of the year, the other proposed
amendments were still awaiting enactment.
Despite these advances, women remained
inadequately protected from violence,
including sexual violence, under the law.
For example, a provision under which men
who rape girls under the age of 18 are
granted immunity from criminal prosecution
if they marry their victim remained in force.
Women’s rights groups continued their
long campaign for a comprehensive law to
combat violence against women. Women also
continued to face discrimination under the
Family Code in relation to marriage, divorce,
child custody and inheritance. 5
IMPUNITY
The authorities took no steps to investigate
thousands of enforced disappearances
and other human rights abuses committed
during the internal conflict of the 1990s
and in subsequent years. Families of those
forcibly disappeared continued to demand
information about the fate of their relatives,
including on the anniversary of the vote
for the Charter for Peace and National
Reconciliation, which gave immunity to
the security forces and criminalized public
criticism of their conduct.
The UN Human Rights Committee ruled
on five cases of enforced disappearance
and urged the authorities to investigate them
thoroughly, bring the perpetrators to justice
and provide effective remedies to the relatives
of the disappeared.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15The authorities took no steps to implement
the UN Committee against Torture’s
recommendations, issued in November 2013,
on the death of Mounir Hammouche, who
died in the custody of the Department for
Information and Security (DRS) in December
2006. The Committee called for an impartial
investigation into his death, with a view to
ensuring the prosecution of those responsible
for his torture, and for his relatives to be
afforded full redress.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
Armed groups carried out a series of attacks
targeting members of the security forces. In
September, the Jund al-Khalifa armed group
abducted and killed French national Hervé
Gourdel, and posted a video on the internet
showing him beheaded.
The authorities and the media reported
scores of killings of members of armed groups
by the security forces but disclosed few
details of the circumstances in which these
killings occurred, prompting fears that some
may have been extrajudicial executions.
The DRS, despite reports of infighting
among decision-makers over its role,
continued to wield wide powers of arrest
and detention, including incommunicado
detention of terrorism suspects, facilitating
torture and other ill-treatment. In June,
the President issued Decree 14-183. This
established a judicial investigation service
within the DRS charged with preventing
and suppressing acts of terrorism, acts that
undermine state security and the activities of
international criminal organizations deemed
to threaten Algeria’s national security.
In March, the US authorities returned
Ahmed Belbacha to Algeria from Guantánamo
Bay, Cuba, where they had imprisoned him
without trial for over 12 years. In 2009 an
Algerian court sentenced him after a trial
held in absentia to 20 years’ imprisonment.
In December, he was acquitted of terrorism
charges by the Algiers criminal court.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Migrants continued to face abuses including
discrimination and arbitrary deportation.
The government did not disclose how many
migrants it expelled but they were reported to
number several hundred, with many expelled
without due process and safeguards.
Irregular or undocumented migrants
remained vulnerable to violence, xenophobia
and expulsion. In January, a woman from
Cameroon was detained for illegally residing
in Algeria when she went to the police in the
city of Oran to report being raped.
Thousands of Algerian would-be migrants
known as “harragas”, and foreign nationals,
mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, continued
to attempt the hazardous sea crossing from
Algeria to Europe, despite a 2009 law that
criminalized “illicit” exit from Algeria using
forged documents or through locations other
than official border exit ports.
DEATH PENALTY
Death sentences were imposed; no
executions have been carried out since 1993.
In November, Algeria voted in support of a
UN General Assembly resolution calling for a
worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.

57ANGOLA related to freedom of expression, association
and assembly.
Republic of Angola
Head of state and government: José Eduardo dos
Santos HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
Freedom of association and assembly
continued to be suppressed. Thousands of
families were forcibly evicted. A youth was
tried and acquitted for criminal defamation
against the President and the trial of
another man for criminal defamation against
state officials commenced. The trial of state
agents in connection with the disappearance
of two men in 2012 started, was suspended
and then restarted.
BACKGROUND
In January, President José Eduardo dos
Santos became chair of the International
Conference on the Great Lakes Region.
There were reports of sporadic political
violence between members of the ruling
People’s Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (Movimento Popular de Libertação
de Angola, MPLA) and the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (União
Nacional para a Independência Total de
Angola, UNITA).
From 28 April to 12 May, Angola hosted
the 55th Ordinary Session of the African
Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights
in the capital, Luanda.
Between 16 and 31 May, Angola
conducted a general population and housing
census. The census was the first since 1970,
prior to independence. The preliminary
results, which were released in October, set
the population at above 24.3 million with 52%
being women.
Angola’s human rights record was assessed
under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR)
in October. 1 Angola accepted 192 out of a
total of 226 recommendations made. It also
took the remaining 34 recommendations
under further consideration, including those
58
Authorities carried out forced evictions
on a larger scale than in the past couple
of years. At least 4,000 families had their
homes demolished and were forcibly evicted
in Luanda province. At least 700 of these
families were left without adequate housing.
There were also reports of evictions in other
provinces, including Cabinda.
From 20 January a reported 2,000 families
were forcibly evicted from their homes in
the Chicala neighbourhood of Luanda. The
houses had been earmarked for demolition
for two years. Some of those forcibly evicted
were rehoused in Zango in Luanda, while
others were given tents in an undeveloped
area in Kissama, about 100km from the city.
It was only in September that they received
land and iron sheets to construct houses.
From 28 May to 6 June a reported 600
families had their homes demolished and
were forcibly evicted from the Areia Branca
neighbourhood of Luanda. It is believed they
were evicted to make way for construction of
a hotel. Armed police, including riot police
and a canine brigade, reportedly beat those
being evicted. Most of the residents had
lived in the area for six to 10 years and some
reported that they had legal title to the land.
The families were moved to a location in the
Samba district of Luanda and reportedly
remained there at the end of the year in
makeshift cardboard houses.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Police and security forces used force or the
threat of force, as well as arbitrary detentions,
to suppress peaceful demonstrations in
Angola. 2 On a number of occasions police
detained demonstrators and beat them before
leaving them hundreds of kilometres away
from where they were detained. In July, young
demonstrators began demonstrating in the
informal settlements as part of what they call
the project “Movement for Demonstrations
Amnesty International Report 2014/15in the Musseques” (o projecto Movimento
das Manifestações nos Musseques, MMM).
Musseques is the colloquial word for informal
settlements in Angola. According to the youth
organizers, the movement aimed to peacefully
demonstrate for better living conditions in the
informal settlements.
Police reportedly beat and arrested
young people peacefully demonstrating
on the anniversary of the 27 May 1977
killings. About 100 people reportedly met
at Independence Square in Luanda to
demonstrate and call for commissions of
inquiry into the 1977 killings, as well as those
of three activists in 2012 and 2013. Police
detained 20 young people for several hours
and reportedly beat them before leaving them
in Catete, some 60km outside Luanda.
On 21 June, riot police used teargas and
violently dispersed a peaceful protest of
the Teachers' Union, Sindicato Nacional de
Professores (SINPROF), in Lubango and
arrested 20 teachers. The teachers were
demonstrating to demand overdue payment
of their salaries. They were released on 23
June after acquittal in a summary trial.
UNLAWFUL KILLINGS
Police and security forces continued to enjoy
impunity for some cases of unlawful killings.
Police and security forces were responsible
for unlawful killings in various provinces
including Luanda, Malanje, Lunda Sul and
Lunda Norte.
In May, plain-clothed police officers
identified as belonging to the 32nd Police
Station of Kilamba Kiaxi district in Luanda
reportedly shot and killed Manuel Samuel
Tiago, Damião Zua Neto “Dani” and Gosmo
Pascoal Muhongo Quicassa “Smith”.
Witnesses stated that the youths had been
in a vehicle parked outside a canteen in the
28 de Agosto neighbourhood of Kilamba
Kiaxi. The police stopped beside the vehicle
and reportedly fired shots at it. Manuel
Samuel Tiago’s brother, who witnessed the
scene, reported that his brother had got
out of the car and pleaded with the police
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
to stop shooting, but had been shot by the
police officer. An investigation into the case
was instituted. No further information was
available by the end of the year.
In July a private security guard shot
and killed Lucas Tiago in Cuango, Lunda
Norte. Police and private security guards
were reportedly in the area carrying out an
operation against illegal diamond mining
and in the process Lucas Tiago was shot in
the back. This resulted in a confrontation
between the other diamond miners and
the police and security guards. Police and
security guards reportedly arrested 22 miners.
An investigation was instituted into Lucas
Tiago’s death. No further information was
available by the end of the year.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Authorities continued to subject individuals to
criminal defamation charges. The appeals of
two journalists, Armando Chicoca and William
Tonet, against their individual convictions for
criminal defamation in 2011, had still not
been heard.
On 14 August, Manuel Nito Alves was
tried and acquitted of criminal defamation
against the President of Angola due to lack of
sufficient evidence. The charges were brought
against him in connection with commissioning
T-shirts with words deemed to be offensive
to the President. He had been arrested by
police officers and State security agents on 12
September 2013, when he was 17 years old,
as he was collecting the T-shirts in the store
where the printing had been commissioned.
On 19 August, journalist and human
rights activist Rafael Marques de Morais
was arraigned before the Luanda Provincial
Court on charges of criminal libel brought
against him by the head of the Intelligence
Bureau at the Presidency, six other generals
and the mining company Sociedade Mineira
do Cuango (SMC). The charges related to
a book, Diamantes de Sangue: Tortura e
Corrupção em Angola (Blood Diamonds:
Torture and Corruption in Angola) that
had been published in Portugal. The book
59implicates the head of the Intelligence
Bureau and the six generals in human rights
violations in the diamond mines of the Lunda
Norte and Lunda Sul provinces. Rafael
Marques de Morais is reportedly being sued
for US$1.2 million and could face a prison
sentence. No trial date had been set at the
time of writing.
Police beat and arrested journalists
reporting on human rights violations. At least
two journalists were detained for reporting on
police activities.
On 2 February, police detained Queirós
Anastácio Chiluvia, a journalist of the
UNITA radio station, Rádio Despertar, as
he attempted to report on shouts for help
of detainees for a fellow detainee in the
Municipal Police Command of Cacuaco.
Queirós Anastácio Chiluvia was reportedly
held for five days without charge before
being tried and convicted on 7 February for
insulting the police, defamation and working
illegally as a journalist. He was sentenced
to six months' imprisonment which was
suspended for two years.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
The whereabouts of journalist Milocas
Pereira (who disappeared in 2012), Cláudio
António “Ndela” and Adilson Panela Gregório
“Belucho” (who both disappeared in 2013)
were still unknown. A trial opened into the
disappearance of two men in the Luanda
Provincial Court.
On 18 November the trial of eight state
agents for the abduction in May 2012 and
subsequent murder of Silva Alves Kamulingue
and Isaías Sebastião Cassule was restarted in
the Luanda Provincial Court. It initially started
on 1 September and was suspended on 4
September as one of the accused, the Head
of the State Security and Intelligence Service
at the time of the abduction, was promoted
to the position of General reportedly by
President Eduardo dos Santos. The trial had
to be suspended as the Luanda Provincial
Court does not have the jurisdiction to try a
General. On 22 September, the President
60
revoked the promotion and ordered an
investigation into the process of promotion.
No further information regarding the trial was
available at the end of the year.

ARGENTINA
Argentine Republic
Head of state and government: Cristina Fernández
de Kirchner
Women continued to face obstacles to
accessing legal abortions. Discrimination
against Indigenous Peoples remained
a concern. Courts held trials for crimes
committed during the military dictatorship.
Reports of torture were not investigated.
BACKGROUND
In December 2013, the police went on strike
over pay sparking violence and looting around
the country. At least 18 people were killed.
The violence spread across many of the 23
provinces; hundreds of people were injured
and thousands of businesses damaged.
Under the Universal Jurisdiction Principle,
the justice system also investigated crimes
against humanity committed during the
Spanish Civil War and the Franco era (1936
to 1975). In April, the Spanish Court of
Justice rejected petitions to extradite two
former security agents to Argentina.
Also in April, in Tucumán Province, 10
defendants accused of the kidnapping
and forced prostitution of Marita Verón in
Amnesty International Report 2014/152002 had their acquittals revoked and were
sentenced to prison terms.
WOMEN ́S RIGHTS
More than half of jurisdictions did not have
protocols in place for hospitals to guarantee
access to abortions, which were legal if the
pregnancy resulted from sexual abuse or put
the woman ́s life or health at risk. In March,
the Supreme Court rejected the motion for
a public hearing to evaluate the necessary
measures to effectively enforce its March
2012 sentence, which dispelled any doubts
about the legality of abortions.
In April, the authorities of a hospital in
Moreno, Buenos Aires Province, denied a
13-year-old girl an abortion whose pregnancy
was the result of rape, due to her gestation
of 23 weeks and health, despite neither the
World Health Organization nor international
norms specifying terms for access to this
right. The abortion was finally carried out in a
private facility. 1
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
Although the National Constitution recognized
Indigenous Peoples’ rights to ancestral land
and to participation in natural resource
management, these rights were rarely fulfilled.
In April, the La Primavera community (Potae
Napocna Navogoh) in the Formosa Province
rejected the land demarcation process,
claiming that the provincial and national
government had not respected their rights
to consultation and free, prior and informed
consent. At the same time, authorities
were using the judicial system to prosecute
individuals fighting for their rights. The
leader of La Primavera, Félix Díaz, was tried
in May for the theft of two police weapons
during a 2010 community protest; he denied
the allegations. Indigenous communities
also faced violence at the hand of civilians;
perpetrators were not brought to justice.
In March, the Comunidad India Quilmes,
an Indigenous community in the northwest
of the country, was attacked with firearms,
bats and chains. Armed intruders assaulted
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
and shot at the villagers and took over
the community‘s holy site called “ciudad
sagrada”. Seven residents were injured. The
community was trying to reclaim their sacred
land through the national judicial system.
At the end of the year, no one had been
prosecuted for the usurpation. Investigations
into the attacks were under way.
TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
Throughout the country, courts conducted
public trials for crimes against humanity
committed under the military rule from 1976
to 1983. In Buenos Aires, 22 accused were
prosecuted for their alleged involvement in
the Plan Condor, an agreement between the
military governments of Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay to
eliminate their political opponents.
Also, trials were held for more than 100
defendants accused of crimes committed in
the clandestine detention and torture centres
in the School of Navy Mechanics in Buenos
Aires, and La Perla in Córdoba, among others.
IMPUNITY
18 July marked the 20 th anniversary of the
attack against the building of the Argentine
Israelite Mutual Association in Buenos Aires,
which left 85 people dead. The government
failed to provide justice and reparation to
the victims. Iran refused to comply with
an Argentine court order which called for
the capture of five suspects. In 2013, the
Argentine and Iranian governments signed
an agreement to interrogate these suspects
in Tehran, but the accord did not take effect.
In Argentina, high-ranking officials, including
former president Carlos Menem, were tried
for diverting the investigation. The public trial
was pending at the end of the year.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In April, the government regulated the
National System for the Prevention of Torture
but failed to create a National Committee,
which should have been integrated with
legislators, government officials and civil
61society organization representatives. The
Committee’s functions would include visiting
detention centres and establishing criteria for
the use of force, control of overpopulation and
transfer regulations.
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
were not investigated, as in the cases of
prisoners Marcelo Tello and Iván Bressan,
imprisoned in the province of Santiago del
Estero. 2
In Mendoza, there were recurring reports
of torture but no one was brought to justice. A
number of jails were overcrowded and some
prisoners were kept in isolation for more than
20 hours a day. 3

the Armenia-Azerbaijan border turned into
heavy fighting resulting in the reported death
of 13 Azerbaijani soldiers and five Armenians,
including two civilians.
On 17 July, the Armenian government
announced its plans to sign an agreement
joining the Russia-led Eurasian Economic
Union by the end of the year, after it had
opted out of signing the EU Association
Agreement in 2013.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Police broke up peaceful protests using
excessive force on a number of occasions
throughout the year. On 7 March, hundreds
gathered outside the Ministry of Finance to
protest against a controversial pension reform
proposal. Police dispersed the peaceful
protesters using excessive force. Three
persons were arrested, fined and released
the next day; two were allegedly ill-treated
while in detention. On 23 June, police
violently dispersed around 50 demonstrators
in Yerevan protesting against electricity price
increases, arresting 27. Later the same day,
police officers physically assaulted three
journalists waiting for the release of protesters
outside the Kentron police station.

WOMEN’S RIGHTS
ARMENIA
Republic of Armenia
Head of state: Serzh Sargsyan
Head of government: Hovik Abrahamyan
Peaceful protesters were dispersed by police
using excessive force in several instances.
Activists working on controversial issues
were threatened and attacked.
BACKGROUND
Between July and August, skirmishes in the
disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh along
62
On 5 November, staff of the NGO Women’s
Resource Centre and other women’s rights
activists were threatened and verbally
assaulted as they were leaving a court room
where they had been assisting a victim of
domestic violence. In 2013, the Women’s
Resource Centre had received anonymous
death threats following its calls for gender
equality legislation. No effective investigations
into either of these incidents had been
conducted by the end of the year.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
The adoption of a draft bill prohibiting all
forms of discrimination was put on hold, while
provisions expressly prohibiting discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation were
Amnesty International Report 2014/15removed. The anti-discrimination bill was
drafted as part of the requirements for
Armenia’s EU Association membership,
but was abandoned after the government
opted instead to join the Russia-led Eurasian
Economic Union.
On 25 July 2013, a court in Yerevan
sentenced two young men who threw Molotov
cocktails into a lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex people friendly bar
to two-year suspended sentences. Despite
admitting the homophobic motives behind
their attack, both men were amnestied in
October 2013.
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
By the end of the year, all 33 Jehovah’s
Witnesses who had been detained for refusing
to perform alternative service in previous
years were released and required to perform
alternative service.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Local human rights defenders continued to
raise concern over high numbers of reported
beatings and ill-treatment in police custody.
Authorities still had to effectively investigate
the allegations of ill-treatment in custody of
the opposition leader Shatn Harutyunyan.
Shatn Harutyunyan and 13 other activists
were arrested following clashes with the
police on 5 November 2013, when they
were attempting to march to the presidential
building. Allegations of ill-treatment by two
activists detained during protests on 7 March
also remained without effective investigation.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
AUSTRALIA
Australia
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Sir Peter Cosgrove (replaced Quentin Bryce in
March)
Head of government: Tony Abbott
Australia’s hard-line approach to asylum-
seekers continued, with those arriving
by boat either sent back to their country
of departure, transferred to offshore
immigration detention centres, or detained
in Australia. Indigenous Peoples continued
to be heavily over-represented in prisons
despite comprising only a fraction of
the population, with Indigenous youth
being imprisoned at 25 times the rate of
non-Indigenous youth. Regressive new
legislation, introduced in the name of
counter-terrorism and security, failed to
protect the rights to privacy and freedoms of
expression and movement.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Australia maintained its offshore processing
policy, transferring anyone who arrived by
boat after 19 July 2013 to Australian-run
immigration detention centres on Papua
New Guinea’s Manus Island or Nauru.
By 1 December 2014, approximately
2,040 asylum-seekers were detained in
these centres, including 155 children on
Nauru. Violence and possibly inadequate
medical treatment resulted in the deaths of
two asylum-seekers at the Australian-run
immigration detention centre on Manus Island
(see Papua New Guinea entry).
Australia continued to turn away boats
containing asylum-seekers. By September,
12 boats with 383 people on board had been
turned back at sea. An additional two boats
were returned directly to Sri Lanka.
In October, the government introduced
legislation to “fast track” the processing of
over 24,000 asylum applications that had
63been suspended. The legislation removed
a number of important safeguards and will
allow people to be returned to other countries
regardless of Australia’s non-refoulement
obligations under international law.
Australia also maintained its mandatory
detention policy for those arriving without
valid visas. By 1 December, there were 3,176
individuals in detention centres in mainland
Australia and on Christmas Island, including
556 children. In August, the government
announced it would transfer the majority
of children and their families from onshore
detention centres to the community on
bridging visas.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
Due to the failure of successive governments
to effectively address Indigenous
disadvantage, Indigenous Peoples continued
to be over-represented in prisons. They
comprised 27.4% of adults and 57.2% of
juveniles in prisons, despite accounting for
just 2.3% of all adults and 5.5% of youth in
the general population.
In August, a young Aboriginal woman died
in police detention in Western Australia when
she was returned to custody twice by the local
hospital with serious internal injuries. She
had been detained to pay a fine, a policy that
disproportionately affects Indigenous Peoples.
Between September and December, the
Western Australian government demolished
the majority of buildings in the remote
Aboriginal community of Oombulgurri
following a 2011 forced eviction. Many remote
communities across Australia were at risk
following the Federal government’s decision
in September to discontinue funding essential
and municipal services.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
National laws were introduced broadening
intelligence agency powers, monitoring
online activity and preventing the reporting
of unlawful conduct by members of those
agencies. New laws criminalized travel to
areas abroad designated by the government
64
as places where a listed terrorist organization
was engaged in “hostile activity”, while
shifting the evidentiary burden on to the
accused. The operation of controversial
preventative detention and control orders
were extended and an ill-defined offence of
“advocating” terrorism introduced.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Australia had its fifth periodic review
before the UN Committee against Torture
in November. The Committee criticized
Australia for continuing with its policies of
mandatory detention and offshore processing
of asylum-seekers. It also raised concerns
about overcrowding in prisons and the
disproportionately high rates of Indigenous
incarceration. The Committee called on
Australia to swiftly ratify the Optional Protocol
to the Convention against Torture.
AUSTRIA
Republic of Austria
Head of state: Heinz Fischer
Head of government: Werner Faymann
Chronic neglect of detainees in preventive
detention was exposed. Inquiries were
ongoing into allegations of excessive use
of force by police during demonstrations.
Second-partner adoption was made legal
for same-sex partners. Protection gaps
remained in anti-discrimination legislation.
A new humanitarian programme to grant
refugee status to 1,000 Syrian nationals
was launched. Asylum procedures remained
long and the provision of independent legal
advice to asylum-seekers was inadequate.
Austria ratified the Council of Europe
Convention on preventing and combating
violence against women and domestic
violence and the Arms Trade Treaty.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15PRISON CONDITIONS
Media investigations exposed structural
shortcomings in the juvenile prison and
preventive detention systems. In May, reports
of the neglect of detainees prompted the
Minister of Justice to accelerate the planned
reform of the preventive detention system
for dangerous offenders. Recommendations
issued in October 2013 by a taskforce on
the detention of juveniles, established by
the Ministry of Justice, were gradually being
implemented. Also in May, media reports
revealed that in Stein prison a 74-year-old
man held in preventive detention since
2008 had been gravely neglected for several
months, including being left without medical
care. Criminal investigations were opened
against prison officials and guards.
REFUGEES, ASYLUM-
SEEKERS AND MIGRANTS
In April, Austria launched a new humanitarian
admission programme for 1,000 Syrian
refugees from countries neighbouring Syria
and committed to granting refugee status to
all upon arrival.
The asylum procedure remained long,
often lasting several years. The authorities
failed to ensure effective and adequate
access for all asylum-seekers to independent
legal advice throughout the procedure.
Asylum-seekers’ access to adequate
housing, social benefits and health care
remained inadequate. Conditions in some
reception centres were reportedly poor and
unhygienic and in some cases amounted to
degrading treatment.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
In January and May, clashes between
police and protesters prompted allegations
that police used excessive force to
contain demonstrators. An inquiry by the
Ombudsman Board was ongoing. In May,
the Minister of the Interior told media that
police officers could be equipped with body
cameras. A group of experts was instructed
to look into their use. The Minister reiterated
the government’s rejection of a compulsory
identification system for police officers.
DISCRIMINATION
Legal amendments were introduced to allow
same-sex couples to adopt each other’s
biological children, following a European
Court of Human Rights judgment in February
2013. In all other circumstances, adoption
continued to be denied to same-sex couples.
Despite the government’s commitment in
the UN Universal Periodic Review follow-up
process to fill protection gaps, the Anti-
Discrimination Law did not ensure equal
protection against all forms of discrimination.
Gaps remained in particular as to protection
against discrimination on the basis of religion
and belief, age and sexual orientation in the
access to goods and services.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
AZERBAIJAN
Republic of Azerbaijan
Head of state: Ilham Aliyev
Head of government: Artur Rasizade
At least six prominent human rights
defenders were imprisoned and leading
human rights organizations forced to shut
down or cease their activities. Independent
journalists continued to face harassment,
violence and trumped-up criminal charges.
Freedom of assembly remained restricted.
There were frequent reports of torture and
other ill-treatment.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
NGO leaders continued to face threats and
harassment from the authorities, including
raids by security forces, the confiscation of
equipment and imposition of travel bans. At
least 10 leading human rights NGOs were
prevented from operating as their bank
accounts were frozen under a high-profile
criminal investigation from May onwards.
65Additional restrictions concerning NGO
registration and activities were introduced in
the law and used arbitrarily to open criminal
proceedings against several NGO leaders.
On 13 May, the Prosecutor General’s Office
launched an investigation into a number of
foreign and local NGOs leading to the arrest
of six prominent human rights defenders in
connection with their organizations' activities.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
The authorities continued to imprison
government critics, political activists and
journalists. At the end of the year, there were
at least 20 prisoners of conscience.
Journalist Hilal Mammadov, sentenced
in earlier years under charges of drug
possession and treason, remained in prison.
Khadija Ismayilova, an outspoken
investigative journalist who had published
extensively on corruption and human rights
violations, was arrested on 5 December on
charges of “inciting someone to attempt
suicide”. She also faced separate charges of
criminal libel. Khadija Ismayilova had been
previously targeted and harassed by the
authorities, including with the imposition of a
travel ban prior to her arrest.
Online and social media activities critical
to the authorities continued to be prosecuted
on fabricated charges, typically drugs-related.
Among these cases were Abdul Abilov and
Rashad Ramazanov, both arrested and
sentenced in 2013, to five and a half and nine
years in prison respectively. Political activist
Faraj Karimov, who co-ordinated popular
Facebook groups calling for the resignation
of the President, and his brother Siraj
Karimov, were arrested in July on spurious
drugs charges.
Nine activists from the pro-democracy
youth organization NIDA were arrested
between March and May 2013 and in
January 2014 on trumped-up charges
ranging from illegal drugs and weapon
possession to organizing public disorder. They
were sentenced to imprisonment ranging
from six to eight years in May. All claimed
66
innocence at the time of detention, although
some later made confessions, allegedly under
duress. Shahin Novruzlu and Bakhtiyar
Guliyev were released on 18 October under
a presidential pardon after they had sent
clemency appeals to the President, thereby
“recognizing” their crimes. Activists Zaur
Gurbanli and Uzeyir Mammadli were released
on 29 December following a presidential
pardon. Mammad Azizov, Rashad Hasanov,
Rashadat Akhundov, Ilkin Rustamzade and
Omar Mammadov remained imprisoned.
Opposition activists Ilgar Mammadov, Tofig
Yagublu and Yadigar Sadigov, arrested in
2013 on charges of inciting public disorder
and hooliganism, were given prison sentences
of seven, five and six (reduced to four on
appeal) years respectively. On 22 May, the
European Court of Human Rights ruled that
the actual purpose of Ilgar Mammadov’s
arrest was to “silence or punish” him for
criticizing the government.
In a major crackdown on human rights
activists, six prominent NGO leaders were
remanded on charges of fraud, illegal
entrepreneurship and “abuse of power".
On 26 May, Anar Mammadli, chairman,
and Bashir Suleymanli, executive director,
of the Election Monitoring and Democracy
Studies Centre (EMDS) were sentenced to five
years and six months’ and three years and
six months’ imprisonment respectively. EMDS
had exposed electoral violations during the
presidential election in October 2013.
Prominent human rights defender Leyla
Yunus, director of the Peace and Democracy
Institute, was arrested on 30 July, followed by
her husband Arif Yunus’ arrest on 5 August.
They were charged with “crimes” relating
to their NGO work, including treason in
connection with activities to promote peace
and reconciliation with Armenia over the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Rasul Jafarov, founder of the NGO Human
Rights Club (HRC), was arrested on 2 August.
HRC had been denied registration since
its establishment in 2010. Intigam Aliyev, a
human rights lawyer renowned for helping in
Amnesty International Report 2014/15dozens of cases reaching the European Court
of Human Rights (ECtHR), was arrested on 8
August 2014.
Former prisoners of conscience, human
rights defenders Bakhtiyar Mammadov
and Ihlam Amiraslanov, were released
on 9 December 2013 and 26 May 2014
respectively under presidential pardon. Youth
activist Dashgin Melikov was released on
parole on 8 May 2014, and journalist Sardar
Alibeyli was released on 29 December 2014.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Independent journalists continued to face
threats, violence and harassment. On 26
December, the offices of Radio Free Europe/
Radio Liberty’s Azerbaijani service were
raided and sealed off by members of the
Prosecutor’s Office without official explanation
after confiscating documents and equipment.
Twelve radio employees were detained
and questioned, and released after signing a
document on non-disclosure.
On 21 August, journalist and NGO activist
Ilgar Nasibov was severely beaten by several
men who stormed the office of the Democracy
and NGO Development Resource Centre
in Nakhichevan, an autonomous exclave of
Azerbaijan. He suffered severe head injuries,
including broken facial bones. The authorities
opened an investigation against one alleged
assailant. Charges were also brought against
Ilgar Nasibov for allegedly stepping on the
assailant’s foot first.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Demonstrations remained effectively
prohibited outside officially designated, and
typically remote, areas. In central Baku, the
capital, law enforcement authorities used
violence and excessive force to prevent and
break up “unauthorized", peaceful assemblies
throughout the year.
On 1 May, around 25 youth activists
peacefully gathered in Sabir Garden, in Baku,
to commemorate May Day. Within minutes,
dozens of plain-clothed and uniformed police
officers violently broke up their assembly.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Protesters were beaten and dragged into
police cars. Six were arrested, including
two minors who were released the same
day. The remaining four were sentenced to
administrative detention ranging from 10 to
15 days.
On 6 May, some 150 people gathered
peacefully outside the court building in Baku
where NIDA activists were standing trial but
were forcefully dispersed by plain-clothed
and uniformed police officers. At least 26
protesters, including one journalist, were
dragged into a bus and taken to a police
station. Five were sentenced to administrative
detention ranging from 15 to 30 days, and
12 protesters received fines of 300-600
manats (US$380-760) for participating in an
“unauthorized demonstration".
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment was frequently
reported, but allegations were not effectively
investigated.
Kemale Benenyarli, an activist of the
opposition party Azerbaijani Popular Front
Party, was arrested on 6 May during the NIDA
trial. She complained of beating and other ill-
treatment inside Nasimi District Police Station
after she refused to sign a “confession"
written by the police. She was punched,
dragged and locked in a cell, where she was
kept without food or water until her trial the
following morning. Another arrested protester,
Orkhan Eyyubzade, reported being stripped
naked, dragged by the hair, punched, kicked
and threatened with rape after he engaged
in an argument with police officers during his
detention on 15 May.
Three of the arrested NIDA activists,
Mahammad Azizov, Bakhtiyar Guliyev and
Shahin Novruzlu, appeared on national
television on 9 March 2013, “confessing”
their plans to use violence and cause disorder
during a forthcoming “unauthorized" street
protest. Mahammad Azizov told his lawyer
that he had been forced to “confess” under
threats of prosecution against members of
his family. Shahin Novruzlu, who was 17
67at the time, was questioned without the
presence of his legal guardian. Four of his
front teeth were missing as a result of beating
when he subsequently appeared in court.
No investigation was launched into his ill-
treatment.
BAHAMAS
Commonwealth of the Bahamas
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Dame Marguerite Pindling (replaced Sir Arthur
Alexander Foulkes in July 2014)
Head of government: Perry Gladstone Christie
There were calls for resumptions in
executions. Excessive use of force was
reported and sentences had yet to be
handed down in cases of torture or other
ill-treatment in detention.
BACKGROUND
A referendum on amendments to the
Constitution on gender equality was
postponed until 2015. The referendum
followed recommendations made in a 2013
report by the Constitutional Commission, and
had originally been scheduled for November
2014. There was opposition to these
amendments, including from local churches,
due to concern that they would allow same-
sex marriage.
Violent crime continued to rise. In 2013,
police reported the second highest homicide
rate since 2000, with 120 murders. No
further statistics on homicide rates were
published in 2014.
DEATH PENALTY
There had been no executions in
the Bahamas since 2000. Hundreds
demonstrated in 2014 for the resumption of
executions in order to reduce crime.
68
In March, the Bahamas rejected a call for
abolition of the death penalty and reiterated
its retentionist position at the OAS.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Torture or other ill-treatment and excessive
use of force by police officers continued to
be reported.
In April, Leslie Louis required medical
treatment after police attempted to arrest
him. He was allegedly beaten, but was not
charged with any criminal offence. When
his sister asked the police why he was being
interrogated, she was pushed and grabbed by
the throat.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
By the end of the year, no judicial sentence
had been handed down in the case of Aaron
Rolle who died in police custody in February
2013. In May 2013, the coroner’s inquest
found the death to be an “unlawful killing”.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS' RIGHTS
The sentencing of five marines before a
military court in November 2013 was still
pending at the end of the year. They were
charged following allegations of ill-treatment
of Cuban asylum-seekers at the Carmichael
Road Detention Centre in May 2013.
A new migration policy put in place on
1 November resulted in dozens of arbitrary
detentions of migrants, disproportionately
targeting Haitians and Bahamian-Haitian
communities with the risk of deportation
without due process.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In February, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Immigration publicly advocated for
greater tolerance in member states of the
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) towards
LGBTI people. In August, the Bahamas’ first
ever Pride event was cancelled due to threats
and intimidation against the organizers.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Despite promises made during the Bahamas’
2013 UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR)
to criminalize marital rape, no legislation had
been approved by the end of the year.
BAHRAIN
Kingdom of Bahrain
Head of state: King Hamad bin ‘Issa Al Khalifa
Head of government: Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al
Khalifa
The government continued to stifle and
punish dissent and to curtail freedoms
of expression, association and assembly.
Security forces used excessive force to
disperse protests, killing at least two people.
Opposition activists sentenced after unfair
trials in previous years continued to be
held, including prisoners of conscience.
Torture of detainees continued and a
climate of impunity prevailed. Twenty-one
Bahrainis convicted on terrorism charges
were stripped of their nationality. The courts
sentenced five people to death; there were
no executions.
BACKGROUND
Tension between the Sunni-dominated
government and main opposition political
associations remained high throughout the
year following the suspension in January of
the National Dialogue initiative. There were
new protests by activists from the Shi’a
majority population demanding political
reform, including some violent protests,
to which the security forces frequently
responded with excessive force, including
shotgun fire. In March, a bomb explosion
at al-Daih village killed three police officers.
In December, bomb attacks in the villages
of Karzakan and Demistan killed a police
officer and another person. The government
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
banned the “14 February Coalition”, a youth
movement, and two other organizations
declaring them terrorist groups.
Bahrain’s first parliamentary elections since
unrest broke out in 2011 were held on 22
November but were boycotted by the main
opposition, led by al-Wefaq National Islamic
Society, the largest Shi’a political association.
Amendments to anti-terrorism legislation
adopted in December increased police
powers, allowing them to detain terrorism
suspects incommunicado for up to 28 days.
Representatives of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights visited
Bahrain from February to May to assess
human rights training needs. In September,
the government issued a mid-term
review of its progress in implementing
recommendations it had accepted at the UN
Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain in 2012.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The authorities continued to clamp down
on dissent. In February, shortly before the
third anniversary of the outbreak of public
protests in 2011, the government increased
the penalty for publicly insulting the King,
the Bahraini flag or the national emblem to
between one and seven years in prison and a
heavy fine.
Dr Sa’eed Mothaher Habib al-Samahiji, an
ophthalmologist, was arrested on 1 July to
serve a one-year prison term imposed on him
in December 2013 on a charge of “publicly
insulting the King” in a speech at the funeral
of a protester killed by a police car. He was
held at Jaw Prison, south of Manama, at the
end of the year.
Other prisoners of conscience held at
Jaw Prison included opposition leaders
and human rights activists sentenced after
unfair trials in previous years. Human rights
defender Nabeel Rajab was released in
May after completing a two-year prison term
for “illegal gathering” but was rearrested
in October on charges of insulting public
institutions. He was released on bail in
November but banned from travel, pending
69a court verdict on his case in January 2015.
Activist Zainab Al-Khawaja was arrested in
October and sentenced in November and
December to prison terms totalling four years
and four months, including three years on
a charge of “insulting the King”. She was
at liberty at the end of the year awaiting the
outcome of an appeal. Women’s rights activist
Ghada Jamsheer, arrested in September,
faced trial on various charges, including
assaulting a police officer. She was released
on bail in December. al-Wefaq for three months. The court action
began shortly after the Public Prosecution
charged al-Wefaq’s leader, Sheikh Ali Salman,
and his deputy with “meeting foreign officials
without notifying” the government, after they
met with the visiting US Assistant Secretary
of State for Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor, Tom Malinowski. In late December,
the authorities arrested Sheikh Ali Salman
on charges including incitement to promote
the change of the political system by force,
threats and other illegal means.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY DEPRIVATION OF NATIONALITY
All public gatherings in the capital Manama
remained indefinitely banned under
government decrees issued in 2013.
However, sporadic protests were held in other
places. The security forces arrested scores
of people for participating in protests; some
received prison sentences.
Ahmad Mshaima’ stood trial in May, five
months after his arrest, charged with “illegal
gathering with an intent to commit crimes
and disturb public security”. He alleged that
security officials tortured him in the days
following his arrest, but the authorities did not
investigate his allegations. He was released
on bail in June but rearrested in November
and sentenced in December to one year’s
imprisonment on a charge of “insulting
the King”.
In December, human rights defender
Mohammad al Maskati and 10 other
defendants were sentenced to six-month
prison terms on charges of “illegal gathering”. In July, the King decreed amendments to the
1963 Nationality Law giving the courts new
powers to strip Bahrainis of their nationality,
including if they are convicted of terrorism
offences. The law also allowed the authorities
to revoke the nationality of people who live
abroad continuously for more than five years
without informing the Ministry of the Interior.
Twenty-one people had their nationalities
revoked by the courts in 2014. In August, the
High Criminal Court revoked the citizenship
of nine Bahraini men after it convicted them
on terrorism-related charges. They also
received prison sentences of up to 15 years
after the court convicted them partly on the
basis of “confessions” that some defendants
alleged had been obtained through torture.
In October, a court sentenced to deportation
several people whose Bahraini nationality
was arbitrarily revoked in 2012. The court
considered that they had remained in the
country illegally after their nationality was
revoked. Their appeal was set for April 2015.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
The government restricted freedom of
association using new powers that allowed
the Minister of Justice to suspend or dissolve
political associations on vague grounds.
The Minister filed suspension cases against
two main political opposition associations,
Wa’ad and al-Wefaq, for alleged irregularities
during their activities. The Ministry of Justice
dropped its case against Wa’ad in November.
In October a court ordered the suspension of
70
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture continued to be reported despite
the establishment of a number of official
bodies to investigate allegations of torture
and other ill-treatment in custody. In some
instances, detainees complained that police
or other security officials violently assaulted
them during arrests and house searches, or
while they were being transported to police
stations or prisons in police vehicles, and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15during interrogation by Criminal Investigations
Directorate officers, when they were held
without access to their lawyers and families
for several days. Methods of torture reported
included severe beating, punching, electric
shocks, suspension by the limbs, rape and
threats of rape, and deliberate exposure to
extreme cold.
Mohamed ‘Ali al-‘Oraibi alleged that
security officials tortured him over five days
following his arrest on 2 February at Manama
International Airport when he arrived from
abroad. He said officials kept him naked
while they interrogated him, subjected him
to electric shocks on his genitals, suspended
him by his limbs and beat him with a stick,
and sexually assaulted him. He was released
on 17 April, pending further investigations.
He complained to the authorities but no
investigation into his alleged torture was
known to have been conducted.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
In March a royal decree (Decree 24 of
2014) was issued regulating the use of force
and firearms.
The security forces regularly used
excessive force to disperse opposition
protests. Among other methods, they fired
shotguns and tear gas at protesters, causing
injuries and at least two deaths.
Sayed Mahmoud Sayed Mohsen, aged 14,
died on 21 May after security forces fired tear
gas and shotguns at protesters participating in
a funeral procession on the island of Sitra. His
family said he had shotgun pellets in his chest
suggesting that he had been shot at close
range. The Ministry of the Interior announced
an investigation but had not disclosed its
outcome by the end of the year.
IMPUNITY
The number of investigations into torture and
other ill-treatment of detainees remained
low and the authorities continued to detain
some of those that the Bahrain Independent
Commission of Inquiry said had been
tortured in 2011. In practice, despite a few
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
prosecutions of low-ranking officers, the
security forces operated with a large degree
of impunity amid continuing reports of torture
of detainees and the use of excessive force
against protesters. The authorities prosecuted
eight police officers in connection with the
killing of one person and the death in custody
of another. One officer, charged with assault,
was acquitted; the others remained on trial
at the end of the year. In the two years since
trials of members of the security forces
began, a total of 15 security officers were
acquitted of torturing or killing protesters and
six were sentenced to between six months’
and three years’ imprisonment in relation to
deaths in custody and killings of protesters.
Two officers accused of causing the death
of 16-year-old Hussein al-Jazairi at a protest
on 14 February 2013 in al-Daih reportedly
remained at liberty and did not stand trial in
2014. They faced charges of assault resulting
in death, but were released on bail in May
2013 by the High Criminal Court. Hussain
al-Jazairi died after he was hit in the chest by
shotgun pellets fired at close range.
In September, the High Court of Justice
in England quashed a ruling by the United
Kingdom (UK) Crown Prosecution Service that
the King of Bahrain’s son, Prince Nasser bin
Hamad Al Khalifa, had diplomatic immunity
in the UK. The High Court ruled that he
could face prosecution in the UK for alleged
complicity in torturing detainees in 2011 if he
entered the UK.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty remained in force for
murder and other crimes. The courts passed
five death sentences during the year, one of
which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in
December. There were no executions.
Mahir Abbas al-Khabaz was sentenced to
death on 19 February after he was convicted
of killing a police officer in 2013. The court
accepted a “confession” allegedly obtained
through torture as evidence against him. An
appeal court confirmed his death sentence
71and he was awaiting a final decision by the
Court of Cassation at the end of the year.
regardless of the strength of the evidence
presented against them.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
BANGLADESH
People’s Republic of Bangladesh
Head of state: Abdul Hamid
Head of government: Sheikh Hasina
Dozens of people were forcibly disappeared.
Journalists and human rights defenders
continued to be attacked and harassed.
Violence against women was a major human
rights concern. Police and other security
forces committed torture with impunity.
Factory workers continued to be at risk
owing to hazardous safety standards in
the workplace. At least one person was
executed with no right to appeal against his
death sentence.
BACKGROUND
The government of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina continued in office after her party,
the Awami League, was declared the winner
in the January elections. The elections
were boycotted by the opposition party, the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and its allies.
More than 100 people were killed during
opposition protests against elections, some
after police opened fire on demonstrators
who were often violent. None of these deaths
were believed to have been investigated.
Supporters of opposition parties reportedly
attacked bus commuters with petrol bombs,
killing at least nine people and injuring
many others.
Verdicts by the International Crimes
Tribunal, a Bangladeshi court set up in
2009 to try crimes committed during the
1971 Bangladesh independence war, were
delivered amid a highly polarized political
atmosphere. Supporters of these trials
demanded death sentences for those on trial
72
The exact number of people who were forcibly
disappeared was not known; some estimates
suggested over 80. Of the documented
cases of 20 people subjected to enforced
disappearance between 2012 and 2014, nine
people were subsequently found dead. Six
had returned to their families after periods
of captivity lasting from weeks to months,
with no news of their whereabouts until
their release. There was no news about the
circumstances of the other five.
Following the enforced disappearance
and subsequent killing of seven people in
Narayanganj in April, three officers of the
Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) were detained
and investigated for their alleged involvement
in abductions and killings; this rose to at
least 17 RAB officers by the end of the year.
This was the first such action since the
formation of the battalion in 2004. Amnesty
International welcomed the investigation as
a move towards holding law enforcement
officials accountable for alleged human rights
violations. However, concerns continued
that the government might drop the cases
if public pressure to bring them to justice
lessened. Apart from this case, there were no
clear indications of a thorough investigation
into other incidents such as the unexplained
abduction and killing of Abraham Linkon in
February. 1
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The government’s use of Section 57 of the
Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) Act severely restricted the right to
freedom of expression. Under this section,
those convicted of violating the Act could
be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in
prison if the charges were brought against
them before 6 October 2013; at that time,
an amendment not only increased the
maximum punishment to 14 years in prison
Amnesty International Report 2014/15but also imposed a minimum punishment of
seven years.
Section 57 of the ICT Act criminalized
a wide array of peaceful actions such
as criticizing Islamic religious views in a
newspaper article or reporting on human
rights violations. At least four bloggers, two
Facebook users and two officials of a human
rights organization were charged under
Section 57 of the ICT Act during 2013-2014.
They included bloggers Asif Mohiuddin,
Subrata Adhikari Shuvo, Mashiur Rahman
Biplob and Rasel Parvez; and human
rights defenders Adilur Rahman Khan and
Nasiruddin Elan.
More than a dozen media workers,
including journalists, said that they had been
threatened by security agencies for criticizing
the authorities. The threats were usually in
phone calls directly to the journalists, or via
messages to their editors. Many journalists
and talk show participants said they exercised
self-censorship as a result.
Freedom of expression was also threatened
by religious groups. In at least 10 instances,
these groups were reported to have spread
rumours that a certain individual had
used social media to insult Islam, or had
engaged in allegedly anti-Islamic activity
in the workplace. At least five people were
subsequently attacked; two were killed and
others sustained serious injuries. The two
killed were Ahmed Rajib 2 and a Rajshahi
University teacher, AKM Shafiul Islam, who
died of stab wounds in November 2014,
allegedly perpetrated by members of a group
who denounced his opposition to female
students wearing burqa in his class as
“un-Islamic”.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Violence against women remained a major
human rights concern. A women’s rights
organization, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad,
said its analysis of media reports showed that
at least 423 women and girls were subjected
to various forms of violence in October 2014
alone. The organization said that more than
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
100 of those women were raped, of whom
11 were then killed. More than 40 were
subjected to physical violence because
their families could not provide the dowry
demanded by the husband or his family, 16
of whom died from their injuries. Women and
girls were also subjected to domestic violence,
acid attacks and trafficking.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment was
widespread and committed with impunity.
Police routinely tortured detainees in
their custody. Methods included beating,
suspension from the ceiling, electric shocks
to the genitals and, in some cases, shooting
detainees’ legs. At least nine people died in
police custody between January and July
2014, allegedly as a result of torture.
WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Safety standards in factories and other
workplaces were dangerously low. At least
1,130 garment workers were killed and at
least 2,000 more injured when Rana Plaza, a
nine-storey building that housed five garment
factories, collapsed on 24 April 2013. It later
emerged that managers had ordered workers
to go into the building that day despite it
having been closed on the previous day after
cracks had appeared in the walls. A similar
incident had occurred in 2012, when at least
112 workers died in a fire at the Tazreen
Fashions factory in Dhaka after managers
stopped them from escaping, saying it was a
false alarm.
Initiatives to provide compensation to
the victims of workplace disasters involving
the government, global brands and the ILO
proved insufficient, and survivors continued
to struggle to support themselves and
their families.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts continued to impose death sentences.
Eleven were imposed by the International
Crimes Tribunal. One death sentence was
imposed directly by the Supreme Court
73after the government appealed against the
defendant’s life sentence by the Tribunal. He
was executed in December 2013. Prisoners
whose death sentences were upheld on
appeal were at imminent risk of execution.

BELARUS
Republic of Belarus
Head of state: Alyaksandr Lukashenka
Head of government: Mikhail Myasnikovich
Belarus remained the only country in
Europe to carry out executions. Opposition
politicians and human rights activists were
detained for legitimate activities. The right
to freedom of expression was severely
restricted and journalists faced harassment.
Severe restrictions on freedom of assembly
remained in place. NGOs continued to be
arbitrarily denied registration.
DEATH PENALTY
Following 24 months in which there were
no executions, at least three men were
executed in secrecy. Pavel Selyun and
Ryhor Yuzepchuk, both sentenced to
death in 2013, were executed in April and
Alyaksandr Haryunou was executed in
November. Judicial appeals and appeals sent
to the President asking for clemency were
rejected. In all cases, the UN Human Rights
Committee requested that the sentences not
be carried out until it had considered the
respective communications; the Belarusian
authorities proceeded with the executions
74
regardless, in violation of their obligations
under the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR). One other man,
Eduard Lykau, was a death row prisoner at
the end of the year.
In October, the UN Human Rights
Committee ruled that the execution of Vasily
Yuzepchuk in 2010 constituted a violation of
his right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR.
It was the third such ruling by the Committee
against Belarus. The Committee also found
that he had been subjected to torture in order
to extract a confession, that his right to a
fair trial had been violated and that his trial
had failed to meet the necessary criteria for
independence and impartiality.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION – MEDIA
Freedom of expression was severely
restricted. The media remained largely under
state control and was used to smear political
opponents. Independent media outlets were
harassed, and bloggers, online activists and
journalists were subjected to administrative
and criminal prosecution. State-run
distribution outlets refused to disseminate
independent periodicals and internet activity
remained closely monitored and controlled.
In April, the authorities started using Article
22.9 of the Administrative Code (“unlawful
creation and dissemination of mass media
produce”) to prosecute freelance journalists
writing for media outlets based outside
Belarus, claiming that they required formal
accreditation as foreign journalists with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 25 September, Maryna Malchanava
was fined 4,800,000 roubles (US$450)
by a court in Babruisk after an interview
she had recorded locally was broadcast by
Poland-based satellite TV channel, Belsat. At
least three other Belarusian journalists were
fined similar amounts under Article 22.9
and several others received police warnings
or had administrative proceedings opened
against them.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
The Law on Mass Events remained
unchanged, effectively prohibiting street
protests including by a single individual
despite continuing calls from UN human
rights mechanisms for Belarus to review its
restrictive legislation on public assemblies
and to decriminalize the organization of public
events without official permission. Peaceful
protesters were repeatedly arrested and
sentenced to short periods of detention.
The annual rally to mark the anniversary
of the Chernobyl disaster took place in April.
According to civil society representatives,
16 participants were arbitrarily detained in
connection with the event. They included
Yury Rubtsou, an activist from Homel, who
was detained for wearing a T-shirt with the
slogan “Lukashenka, leave!” and accused of
“failing to obey police orders” and “swearing”.
He was sentenced to 25 days' administrative
detention in a trial in which he appeared
topless after police had confiscated his
T-shirt. In August a criminal case was opened
against him, purportedly for insulting the
judge during his earlier court appearance,
and in October he was sentenced in a
closed court hearing to two years and six
months’ imprisonment in an open regime
prison (reduced by a year under an amnesty
law). His appeal was pending at the end of
the year.
In October a local activist and newspaper
distributor, Andrei Kasheuski, was sentenced
to 15 days’ administrative detention
on charges which included holding an
“unauthorized mass event” and wearing a
T-shirt with the slogan “Freedom to Political
Prisoners” with a list of names on the back.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
In the lead-up to the Ice Hockey World
Championship on 9-25 May, 16 civil society
activists were arrested and sentenced to
between five and 25 days’ administrative
detention. Eight were arbitrarily arrested
during or immediately after they attended
a peaceful march commemorating the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Chernobyl nuclear disaster. They were
charged with “petty hooliganism” and
“disobeying police orders”. Eight others,
all known for their political activism, were
detained in the days before the march
under similar charges. They included former
prisoner of conscience Zmitser Dashkevich,
who had ended a three-year prison term in
August 2013. Arrested outside his home on
24 April, Dashkevich was sentenced to 25
days’ administrative detention for “disobeying
police orders” and “violating restrictions
imposed on him following his release from
prison”. His detention lasted almost the entire
period of the championship.
Long-term prisoner of conscience and
former presidential candidate Mikalai
Statkevich was awaiting transfer to a penal
colony, scheduled for January 2015,
to complete his six-year sentence for
participating in post-election demonstrations.
Originally sentenced in 2011, he was
transferred to a strict regime prison in
January 2012.
Eduard Lobau, an activist and member
of youth organization Malady Front, was
released in December having completed a
four-year sentence for alleged random attacks
on pedestrians.
On 21 June, the Chair of the Belarusian
Human Rights Centre “Vyasna” and Vice-
President of the International Federation for
Human Rights, Ales Bialiatski, was released
under a prison amnesty. He had served
almost three years of a four-and-a-half-year
sentence on charges of tax evasion.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
The authorities continued to restrict arbitrarily
the right to freedom of association.
Article 193.1 of the Criminal Code, which
criminalizes activities by unregistered
organizations, continued to be used to
obstruct the legitimate activities of civil society
organizations in Belarus.
In February, Minsk Central District
Court rejected the complaint by Valyantsin
Stefanovich, Deputy Chairman of the NGO
75Human Rights Centre “Vyasna”, against the
blocking of the NGO’s website, with no right
of appeal. The NGO’s registration applications
had been repeatedly rejected. In 2011 the
Prosecutor General’s Office restricted access
to the website under Article 193.1.
In November, the authorities nullified the
residence permit of Russian citizen and
human rights defender Elena Tonkacheva
who was given one month to leave the
country. Her appeal was pending at the
end the year. The permit was due to expire
in 2017. Elena Tonkacheva is head of the
human rights organization Centre for Legal
Transformation and has been living in Belarus
for 30 years. The authorities claimed that
the decision was linked to her violating
public traffic regulations by driving over the
speed limit. It was widely believed that she
had been targeted for her legitimate human
rights activities.
BELGIUM
Kingdom of Belgium
Head of state: King Philippe
Head of government: Charles Michel (replaced Elio
Di Rupo in October)
Detention conditions remained poor
and offenders with mental health issues
continued to be detained in inadequate
structures with limited access to appropriate
health services. In October, the newly
appointed government committed to
creating a National Human Rights
Institution. Transgender people could not
obtain legal gender recognition without
complying with compulsory medical
treatment such as sterilization.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Overcrowding continued to have a detrimental
impact on detention conditions. In March,
76
according to official statistics, the inmate
population exceeded the prisons’ maximum
capacity by more than 22%. In January,
the UN Committee against Torture raised
concerns about poor prison conditions
and recommended greater use of non-
custodial measures.
The Committee also highlighted that
offenders with mental health issues continued
to be detained in psychiatric wards within
regular prisons with very limited access
to adequate health care. In January, the
European Court of Human Rights found in
Lankester v. Belgium that the detention of an
offender in the psychiatric ward of a regular
prison constituted degrading treatment.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
In 2013, an investigation was launched into
the death of Jonathan Jacob, who died in
2010 after being physically assaulted by
police while in custody. The results of the
investigation and the decision regarding its
follow-up, due in October 2014, were still
pending at the end of the year.
DISCRIMINATION
In March, the UN Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination
raised concerns about allegations of
racially motivated violence and ill-
treatment by police against migrants, and
recommended the strengthening of police
complaints mechanisms.
In February, the European Committee
against Racism and Intolerance highlighted
that Muslims, and especially Muslim
women wearing headscarves, continued
to be discriminated against in access to
employment and goods and services.
In 2013, the Board of Education of the
Flemish Community (GO!) confirmed the
general ban on religious symbols and dress in
all its schools in the Flemish-speaking part of
the country. On 14 October 2014, the Council
of State found that the general ban violated
the right to freedom of religion of a Sikh pupil
Amnesty International Report 2014/15who was forbidden to wear the turban in a
secondary school.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In January 2013, the government adopted
a comprehensive roadmap to combat
discrimination on grounds of sexual
orientation and gender identity. In May,
a new law prohibiting discrimination on
grounds of gender identity and expression
was introduced.
While the roadmap included the
commitment to amend the 2007 law on legal
recognition of gender, plans regarding its
amendments remained unclear at the end of
the year. Transgender people were required to
comply with criteria that violated their human
rights in order to obtain legal recognition
of their gender. These included psychiatric
diagnosis and sterilization, as well as other
compulsory medical treatments.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In January the Committee against Torture
expressed concerns about the planned
extradition and refoulement of third-country
nationals to countries that provided diplomatic
assurances. The Committee reiterated that
such assurances did not mitigate the risk of
torture or other ill-treatment.
In September, the European Court of
Human Rights found that the extradition of
Nizar Trabelsi, a Tunisian national, to the USA
in October 2013 amounted to a violation of
Articles 3 and 34 of the European Convention
on Human Rights. Belgian authorities had
ignored the interim measure issued by the
Court on the extradition.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
In February 2014, a country-wide survey
undertaken by Amnesty International found
that a quarter of women in Belgium had
allegedly experienced sexual violence at the
hands of their partners and that 13% had
been raped by someone other than their
partners. A coordinated and comprehensive
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
approach to combat these forms of violence
was still lacking at the end of the year.
BENIN
Republic of Benin
Head of state and government: Thomas Boni Yayi
Municipal elections initially planned for
April 2013 had not been held by the end
of 2014. In June 2013, the government
resubmitted a bill for the revision of the
Constitution. In November 2014 the
Constitutional Court ruled against any
revision of the Constitution that could
prolong the term of office of the President.
The Constitutional Court had previously
ruled in 2011 that parts of the Constitution
relating to the Presidential term could not
be submitted to referendum.
POLITICAL PRISONERS
In May, President Boni Yayi pardoned Patrice
Talon and his associate Olivier Bocco, both
living in France, as well as six other people,
including one woman, who had been
detained in Benin since 2012 and 2013. In
the first case, Patrice Talon, Olivier Bocco
and four others were accused of attempting
to poison the President in October 2012.
In the second case, two men were accused
of crimes against the security of the state
following a suspected coup attempt in
May 2013.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION
AND ASSEMBLY
A demonstration against police violence
was held in March in Cotonou in response
to the break-up by security forces of a
peaceful demonstration by union members
in December 2013, in which over 20 people,
including six women, were injured.
77In June, the Court of First Instance in
Cotonou sentenced John Akintola, publishing
director of L’Indépendant newspaper, to a
three-year suspended prison term and a fine
for “insulting the Head of State” following the
publication of an article concerning possible
illicit financing of trips abroad. The author of
the article, Prudence Tessi, was sentenced
to two months’ imprisonment and the
newspaper was suspended for three months.
DEATH PENALTY
Thirteen people remained under sentence
of death despite Benin’s ratification in
2012 of the Second Optional Protocol to
the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the
death penalty.
BOLIVIA
Plurinational State of Bolivia
Head of state and government: Evo Morales Ayma
Victims of human rights violations
committed during past military regimes
continued to be denied truth, justice and
full reparation. Indigenous Peoples’ rights to
consultation and to free, prior and informed
consent and equal access to sexual and
reproductive rights remained unfulfilled.
BACKGROUND
In October, President Evo Morales was
re-elected for a third term. More than
50% of parliamentary candidates were
women. This was the result of the first time
implementation of the 2010 Electoral Law
gender equality clause.
In October, Bolivia accepted most of
the recommendations of the UN Universal
Periodic Review process, including to
investigate past human rights violations
and ensure a full and effective reparation,
78
to review legislation that criminalizes
abortion and to improve prison conditions.
Concerns around these same issues had
been highlighted by the UN Human Rights
Committee in October 2013 1 and the UN
Committee against Torture in May 2013.
IMPUNITY AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
Five decades after the military and
authoritarian regime (1964–1982), no
progress in providing justice to victims of
political violence or measures to implement a
mechanism to unveil the truth of the human
rights violations committed during that period
was made. 2 The authorities ignored national
and international bodies’ concerns about the
lack of transparency and unfairness of the
reparation process that ended in 2012 and
in which just over a quarter of applicants
qualified as beneficiaries.
In February 2014, a campsite of the
victims’ organization, Platform of Social
Activists against Impunity, for Justice and
Historical Memory of the Bolivian People,
outside the Ministry of Justice was set on fire 3
and files and documents were destroyed.
Preliminary investigations indicated that
the fire was caused by an electrical fault.
However, the organization complained
that it was an intentional attack. Criminal
investigations were ongoing at the end
of the year. Investigations into an attack
against a member of the same victims’
group in February 2013 were reported 4 as
being delayed.
In July, Bolivia’s second request to
extradite former President Gonzalo Sánchez
de Lozada to Bolivia was filed in the USA. He
faced charges in connection with the “Black
October” case, when 67 people were killed
and more than 400 injured during protests in
El Alto, near La Paz, in late 2003. A previous
extradition request was rejected in 2012. In
May 2014, a Federal Judge in the USA had
allowed a civil lawsuit against the former
President and his Minister of Defence for their
responsibility in the events.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Trial proceedings connected to the 2008
Pando massacre in which 19 people, mostly
peasant farmers, were killed and 53 others
injured, continued but were subject to delays.
Hearings in the case of 39 people accused
of involvement in an alleged plot in 2009
to kill President Evo Morales continued.
By the end of the year, there had been no
investigations into allegations of lack of due
process or into the killings of three men in
2009 in connection with the case. In March,
the Prosecutor who resigned after denouncing
political interference in the case and who was
subsequently charged with involvement in
extortion, requested political asylum in Brazil.
In August, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention stated that the detention of one
of the suspects in the case was arbitrary
and recommended his immediate release
and reparation.
In June, criminal proceedings against
three judges of the Constitutional Court were
initiated for breach of duty, among other
crimes, before the Congress. The judges
were suspended.
unwanted pregnancies, and the right to
sexual education in schools, among other
provisions, was still under discussion in
the Congress.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
In November, 14 police officials were charged
in connection with the excessive use of force
in 2011 during a peaceful march against the
construction of a road in the Isiboro-Sécure
Indigenous Territory and National Park. The
Prosecutor’s office dismissed the involvement
of high rank civil authorities, as claimed by
victims. Plans to build the road remained on
hold following a controversial consultation
with the affected Indigenous communities
in 2012.
A new Mining Law passed in May excluded
consultation with Indigenous Peoples for
prospecting and exploration of mining
activities and did not recognize the principle
of free, prior and informed consent in relation
to projects that are going to have an impact
on them. A draft law on Free, Prior and
Informed Consultation was finalized.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
According to a 2014 study by the
Panamerican Health Organization, Bolivia has
the highest rate of violence against women
by an intimate partner and the second
highest rate of sexual violence in the region.
In October, a norm that regulates the budget
and implementation of the 2013 Law 348
to guarantee women’s rights to a life free of
violence was promulgated. Concerns remained over the requirements
specified by the 2013 law to grant legal
identity to NGOs. Under this regulation,
organizations have to specify their
“contribution to the economic and social
development” of the state. In 2013 the UN
Human Rights Committee recommended that
Bolivia eliminate these requirements because
they placed restrictions on the organizations’
ability to operate freely, independently and
effectively.
In January, members of the Consejo
Nacional de Ayllus y Markas del Qullasuyu
(CONAMAQ), who were holding a vigil
outside the organization’s office in La Paz,
were violently evicted by other Indigenous
Peoples’ groups who adjudicated themselves
the leadership of CONAMAQ. There were
complaints that the police did not intervene to
stop the violent eviction.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Although in February the Plurinational
Constitutional Court decided that the request
for judicial authorization for an abortion, as
requested by article 266 of the Criminal Code,
was unconstitutional, the implementation of
the decision was still pending.
A 2012 bill on sexual and reproductive
rights guaranteeing the right to receive
information about sexual and reproductive
health services to prevent unplanned or
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
79In March, the Danish NGO IBIS Dinamarca
closed most of its projects in Bolivia after
the government announced its expulsion
from the country in December 2013, arguing
that they were interfering in political issues
and had contributed to divisions within the
Indigenous movement.
PRISON CONDITIONS
A lack of security and poor prison conditions
remained a concern. Delays in concluding
trials within a reasonable time, the excessive
use of pre-trial detention and the limited use
of alternatives to detention, all contributed
to prison overcrowding. Presidential decrees
enacted in 2013 and 2014 granting pardons
and amnesties, intended to deal with over-
population in prisons, were not having the
expected outcome.
In August, the Ombudsman reported little
progress in the investigation into the deaths
of more than 30 inmates in Palmasola prison,
Santa Cruz, in August 2013. 5
In September, four inmates died and
a dozen were injured in clashes between
inmates in El Abra prison, Cochabamba.
Investigations were ongoing at the end of
the year.

Head of state: Rotating presidency - Bakir

Head of government: Vjekoslav Bevanda
(Incumbent)
High levels of unemployment and
dissatisfaction with government institutions
prompted popular protests that spread
throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BiH) and were accompanied by clashes
between demonstrators and the police. The
prosecution of crimes under international
law continued before domestic courts,
but progress remained slow and impunity
persisted. Many civilian victims of war were
still denied access to justice and reparation.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In February, popular protests, initially fuelled
by the large-scale dismissal of the workforce
of industrial companies in the Tuzla Canton,
spread across the country, resulting in
clashes between demonstrators and the
police. Law enforcement officials subjected at
least 12 detainees, some of them minors, to
ill-treatment while in detention.

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
– JOURNALISTS
At least one journalist was beaten by police
officers while recording the February protests.
Intimidation of journalists by state officials
persisted throughout the year, including
beatings, death threats and a police raid on a
newsroom. The authorities frequently failed to
open investigations into complaints.

DISCRIMINATION
The 2009 judgment of the European Court
of Human Rights in the case of Sejdić-Finci
v. BiH, which found the power-sharing
80
Amnesty International Report 2014/15arrangements set out in the Constitution to
be discriminatory, remained unimplemented.
Under the arrangements, citizens such
as Jews and Roma who do not declare
themselves as belonging to one of the three
constituent peoples of the country (Bosniaks,
Serbs and Croats) are excluded from running
for legislative and executive office. The
discriminatory nature of these arrangements
was confirmed again in July when the
European Court ruled in favour of the plaintiff
in the Zornić v. BiH case.
A number of schools in the Federation
continued to operate under the so-called
"two schools under one roof” arrangement,
resulting in discrimination and segregation
based on ethnicity. Bosniak and Croat pupils
attended classes in the same building while
being physically separated and studying
different curricula.
Roma continued to face widespread and
systematic discrimination in accessing their
basic rights, including to education, work and
health care, entrenching the cycle of poverty
and marginalization. Many Roma were
particularly affected by the poor response of
the authorities to the severe flooding in May.
The number of people at risk of
statelessness, the majority of whom were
Roma, reached a peak of 792 by April but
had significantly decreased by the end of the
year. However, a state-level law on free legal
aid that would, among other provisions, have
assisted Roma with registering in the national
public registry and accessing public services,
was still lacking.
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex (LGBTI) people continued to face
widespread discrimination. In February, three
people were injured as a group of 12-14
masked men interrupted the LGBTI festival
“Merlinka” staged at a cinema in Sarajevo.
The men stormed the premises, shouted
homophobic threats and physically attacked
and injured the three festival participants.
Following their participation in the Belgrade
Pride in September, members of an LGBTI
NGO based in Banja Luka received death
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
threats. Although the Criminal Code of
Republika Srpska contained provisions on
hate crime, there was no investigation into the
threats against the activists.
CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW
Proceedings continued at the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadžić and former General Ratko Mladić,
for genocide, crimes against humanity and
violations of the laws or customs of war,
including at Srebrenica. In October, the
hearing in the Karadžić case ended.
The War Crimes Chamber of the State
Court of BiH made slow progress in the
prosecution of crimes under international law,
and was undermined by repeated criticism by
high-ranking politicians.
The Criminal Code continued to fall short
of international standards relating to the
prosecution of war crimes of sexual violence.
Entity courts continued to apply the Criminal
Code of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia; impunity prevailed in the absence
of a definition of crimes against humanity,
command responsibility, and crimes of sexual
violence. Impunity for war crimes of sexual
violence remained rampant; between 2005
and the end of 2014 less than 100 cases
had come to court. The estimated number
of victims of rape during the war ranged
between 20,000 and 50,000.
In April a Law on Witness Protection was
adopted, but it applied only to witnesses
testifying before the State Court of BiH.
Adequate witness support and protection
measures were absent at entity courts,
despite the fact that half of all pending
war crimes cases were due to be heard at
this level.
Legislation that would enable effective
reparation, including a comprehensive
programme for victims of crimes under
international law, and free legal aid services to
victims of torture and civilian victims of war,
had yet to be put in place. The harmonization
81of the entity laws regulating the rights of
civilian victims of war was still not completed.
By the end of the year, the remains of
435 people had been exhumed at a mass
grave in Tomašica village. The victims had
disappeared and were subsequently killed
by Bosnian Serb forces in the Prijedor
area in 1992. In August, BiH signed a
regional declaration on missing persons,
and committed to establishing the fate and
whereabouts of those 7,800 still missing.
The Law on Missing Persons had not been
implemented at the end of the year, leaving
the families of the missing with no access
to reparation.
BRAZIL
Federative Republic of Brazil
Head of state and government: President Dilma
Rousseff
Serious human rights violations continued
to be reported, including killings by police
and the torture and other ill-treatment of
detainees. Young and Black residents of
favelas (shanty towns), rural workers and
Indigenous Peoples were at particular risk
of human rights violations. Protests that
swept the country, particularly around the
football World Cup, were often suppressed
using excessive and unnecessary force by
the security forces. Arbitrary detentions and
attempts to criminalize peaceful protesters
were reported in various parts of the
country. Although legislation allowing same-
sex marriage was approved, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI)
people continued to face discrimination
and attacks. Brazil continued to play a
significant role on the international stage
on issues such as privacy, the internet and
discrimination based on sexual orientation
and gender identity. Some progress was
82
made in addressing impunity for past
grave human rights violations under the
dictatorship (1964-1985).
BACKGROUND
Brazil continued serving its third mandate
in the UN Human Rights Council, where it
was a key supporter of resolutions against
discrimination based on sexual orientation
and gender identity. At the General Assembly,
the Brazilian and German governments
presented a resolution on privacy in the
internet age, which was approved in
December 2013. In April 2014, Brazil
approved its Civil Framework for the Internet,
ensuring the neutrality of the web and setting
out rules to protect freedom of expression
and privacy.
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE
CONTEXT OF SOCIAL PROTESTS
In 2014, thousands of protesters took to the
streets in the run-up to and during the football
World Cup in June and July. The protests
echoed huge demonstrations that had taken
place the previous year to express discontent
over a number of issues including increased
public transport costs, high spending
on major international sports events and
insufficient investment in public services. The
police frequently responded to protests with
violence. Hundreds of people were rounded
up and arbitrarily detained, some under laws
targeting organized crime, even though there
was no indication that those detained were
involved in criminal activity. 1
In April, ahead of the World Cup, soldiers
from the Army and Marines were deployed
to the Maré complex in Rio de Janeiro.
Initially, it was stated that they would remain
until the end of July, but the authorities
subsequently declared that the troops would
remain there indefinitely. This raised serious
concerns given the weak accountability
mechanisms for human rights abuses during
military operations.
By the end of the year, the only person
convicted of offences related to violence
Amnesty International Report 2014/15during the protests was Rafael Braga Vieira,
a Black homeless man. Although he was
not taking part in a demonstration, he was
arrested for “carrying explosives without
authorization” and sentenced to five years in
prison. The forensic report concluded that
the chemicals in his possession – cleaning
fluids – could not have been used to create
explosives, but the court disregarded
the finding.
Excessive use of force
Military Police often used excessive and
unnecessary force to disperse protesters. 2
In Rio de Janeiro, military police used tear
gas to disperse peaceful protesters on many
occasions, including in confined spaces such
as the Pinheiro Machado Health Centre in
July 2013 and subway stations in June and
September 2013 and June 2014.
Freedom of expression and association –
journalists
According to the Brazilian Association
of Investigative Journalism, at least 18
journalists were assaulted while working
during the World Cup in cities including São
Paulo, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, Belo
Horizonte and Fortaleza. In Rio de Janeiro,
on 13 July, the day of the World Cup final, at
least 15 journalists were assaulted by police
officers while covering a demonstration. Some
had their equipment broken. In February,
Santiago (Ilídio) Andrade, a cameraman,
died after being hit by fireworks being used
by protesters. The police arrested two men
in connection with the killing. They were
charged with intentional homicide and were
awaiting trial at the end of the year.
PUBLIC SECURITY
Public security remained the context for
widespread human rights violations.
According to official statistics, 424 people
were killed by police in the state of Rio de
Janeiro during security operations in 2013.
The first six months of 2014 showed an
increase in the number of such deaths, with
285 people being killed by police, 37% more
than during the same period in 2013.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Claudia Silva Ferreira was shot and
wounded by police officers in a shoot-out
in the Morro da Congonha favela in March.
While she was being taken to the hospital by
police in the boot of their car, she fell out and
was dragged along the ground for 350m. The
incident was recorded and broadcast in the
Brazilian media. At the end of the year, six
police officers were under investigation, but
remained at liberty.
Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira, a dancer,
was found dead in April 2014 following a
police operation in the Pavão-Pavãozinho
favela. The death sparked protests during
which Edilson Silva dos Santos was shot dead
by police. By the end of the year, no one had
been charged in connection with the deaths.
In November, at least 10 people were
killed, allegedly by off-duty military police
officers, in the city of Belém in the state of
Pará. Residents of the neighbourhood told
Amnesty International that military police
vehicles closed off streets prior to the killings
and that people in unidentified cars and
on motorcycles threatened and attacked
residents. 3 There were indications that the
killings may have been a reprisal for the killing
of a policeman.
Ten police officers, including the former
commander of a battalion, were tried
between December 2012 and April 2014 and
convicted in connection with the murder of
Judge Patrícia Acioli in August 2011. She had
been responsible for sentencing 60 officers
convicted of involvement in organized crime.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Severe overcrowding, degrading conditions,
torture and violence remained endemic in
Brazil’s prisons. Several cases regarding
prison conditions were submitted to the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
and Inter-American Court of Human Rights
in recent years and conditions remained a
serious concern.
In 2013, 60 detainees were murdered
in the prison of Pedrinhas, in the state of
Maranhão. More than 18 were killed in the
83prison between January and October 2014.
Videos of beheadings were broadcast in the
media. An investigation into the incident was
continuing at the end of the year.
From April 2013 to April 2014 the courts
sentenced 75 police officers for the killing
of 111 prisoners in the 1992 Carandiru
prison riots. The officers lodged appeals and
remained on active service at the end of the
year. The commander of the police operation
had been convicted in 2001, although this
was overturned; he was murdered by his
girlfriend in 2006. The prison governor and
the Minister of Public Security at the time of
the riots were not charged in connection with
the case.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
There were several reports of torture and
other ill-treatment at the time of arrest
and during interrogation and detention in
police stations.
In July 2013, Amarildo de Souza, a
bricklayer, was detained by the police as
he was returning home in Rocinha, Rio de
Janeiro. He died under torture in the custody
of the local Pacification Police Unit. The
police denied that Amarildo de Souza was
ever in custody despite video footage showing
that he had been detained. Twenty-five police
officers were charged in connection with the
case, including the commander of the unit,
and six of them were detained awaiting trial at
the end of 2014.
The National System to Fight and Prevent
Torture, created by law in 2013, had yet to be
fully established by the end of 2014. Although
the System did not fully meet international
standards in terms of its independence, it
represented an important step forward in
fulfilling the country’s obligations under the
Optional Protocol to the UN Convention
against Torture, which Brazil had ratified
in 2007.
IMPUNITY
The establishment of the National Truth
Commission generated widespread public
84
interest in the human rights violations
committed under the 1964-1985 dictatorship.
This led to the creation of more than
100 truth commissions in states, cities,
universities and trade unions. These
engaged in investigations into cases such
as the enforced disappearance of former
congressman Rubens Paiva in 1971. They
also highlighted less well-known violations
against Indigenous Peoples and rural workers,
such as the military attacks (1968-1975)
against the Waimiri-Atroari in the Amazon
and the torture of peasant farmers during the
Araguaia guerrilla conflict (1967-1974).
The Truth Commission published its final
report on 10 December recommending
that the 1979 Amnesty Law should not
be an obstacle to criminal charges being
brought against the perpetrators of serious
human rights violations. The report also
recommended several public security
reforms such as the demilitarization of
the police. Federal prosecutors trying to
bring the perpetrators of these crimes to
justice condemned the Amnesty Law as
incompatible with international human rights
treaties. To date, judges have rejected these
arguments. However, at the end of the year,
three bills were before Congress which
proposed changes to the interpretation of the
Amnesty Law so that it would no longer apply
to agents of the state charged with crimes
against humanity.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
The National Programme for the Protection of
Human Rights Defenders continued to face
numerous difficulties in fulfilling its mandate,
including lack of resources, judicial insecurity,
lack of coordination with state officials, and
disputes about the scope of the programme
and who should benefit from it. The
authorities refused to include a woman sex
worker known as “Isabel” in the programme.
She had lodged a complaint about police
violence against herself and her colleagues
during their eviction in May 2014 from the
building where they lived in Niterói, in the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15state of Rio de Janeiro. After lodging the
complaint, Isabel was kidnapped and beaten
by men who showed her photos of her son.
Fearing for her safety, she left the area and
was still in hiding at the end of the year.
In April 2013, two men were convicted of
the murder in 2011 of José Cláudio Ribeiro
and Maria do Espírito Santo, rural workers'
leaders in the state of Pará who had reported
illegal logging. In August 2014, a retrial was
ordered of a landowner accused of ordering
their assassination; he had been acquitted of
involvement in the killings in 2013. However,
he evaded arrest and remained at liberty at
the end of the year. Maria do Espírito Santo's
sister, Laísa Santos Sampaio received death
threats because of her human rights work
and was part of the National Programme for
the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
Although she received some protection,
including a police escort, concerns for her
safety persisted.
In the state of Rio de Janeiro, the
government’s failure to guarantee the
safety of the Fishermen’s Association of
Guanabara Bay resulted in the closure of
its headquarters. Its president and his wife
have not been able to return to their home
since November 2012 because of threats to
their lives. Other fishermen from AHOMAR,
such as Maicon Alexandre, also received
death threats. to demarcate the community’s land until
2010, but the process was never completed.
At the end of the year, a bill was pending
in Congress which, if passed, would transfer
responsibility for demarcating Indigenous
land from the Executive to the Legislature,
where the agribusiness lobby was very strong.
The new Mining Code proposal also puts
traditional communities at risk of having
corporate activity on their land without their
permission, in breach of international law.
Quilombola communities continued to fight
for recognition of their right to land. The slow
process of resolving land entitlement claims
resulted in conflict and left communities at
risk of threats and violence from gunmen
and local ranchers. The community of São
José de Bruno in the state of Maranhão was
under direct threat in October 2014 after a
landowner invaded part of their land.
Thirty-four people were killed as a result
of conflict over land in 2013, three of them
in the state of Maranhão. Between January
and October 2014, five people were killed
due to conflict over land in the state. Impunity
for these crimes continued to feed a cycle
of violence.
Those responsible for the killing of
Quilombola leader Flaviano Pinto Neto
in October 2010 had not been brought
to justice, despite the fact that a police
investigation had identified four suspects. 4
LAND DISPUTES AND INDIGENOUS
PEOPLES’ RIGHTS RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Indigenous Peoples and Quilombola
communities (descendants of former slaves)
continued to face grave threats to their
human rights.
In September 2013, the Guarani-Kaiowá
community of Apika'y, in the state of Mato
Grosso do Sul, occupied a sugarcane
plantation that they claim as their traditional
land. A local court ordered them to leave,
but they refused to comply. At the end of the
year they remained on the land but at risk of
eviction. In 2007, the federal government had
signed an agreement with public prosecutors In May 2013 the National Council of Justice
approved a resolution authorizing same-
sex marriage, following a 2011 ruling by
the Supreme Court. However, frequent
homophobic statements by political and
religious leaders continued. Conservative
politicians vetoed attempts by the federal
government to distribute human rights
education materials in schools to curb
discrimination on the grounds of sexual
orientation. Homophobic hate crimes were
frequent. According to the NGO Bahia Gay
Group (Grupo Gay da Bahia), 312 people
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
85were killed as a result of homophobic or
transphobic hate crimes in 2013.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Religious groups continued to put pressure
on the authorities to criminalize abortion
in all circumstances – Brazilian law allows
abortion in cases of rape, threat to the life
of the woman and anencephalic foetuses.
This limited range of possibilities results in
many women resorting to clandestine, unsafe
abortions. In September 2014, the cases
of Jandira dos Santos Cruz and Elisângela
Barbosa caused a national outcry. The two
women died in Rio de Janeiro following
clandestine abortions in clinics. The body of
Jandira dos Santos Cruz was hidden from her
family and burned by clinic employees.
ARMS TRADE
Brazil signed the Arms Trade Treaty on 4 June
2013, the first day it was open for signature.
By the end of 2014, it had yet to ratify the
treaty. The Brazilian government did not
publish data on arms exports and refused
requests under the Freedom of Information
Act from researchers and journalists for
details of the country's involvement in the
arms trade, such as, for example, whether
weapons had been exported to countries
where mass human rights violations were
being committed.

BRUNEI
DARUSSALAM
Brunei Darussalam
Head of state and government: Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah
Lack of transparency and scarcity of
information made independent monitoring
of the human rights situation difficult.
Amid strong international criticism, the
amended Penal Code came into force on
1 May, although it was announced that
its implementation would be phased. The
new Code, purporting to impose Shari’a
law, contained a number of provisions
that violate human rights, widening the
scope of offences punishable by the death
penalty, expanding the imposition of
torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading
punishment, restricting the rights to
freedom of expression and religion or belief,
and discriminating against women. Also in
May, the country’s human rights record was
assessed under the UN Universal Periodic
Review (UPR) mechanism.
DEATH PENALTY
The new Penal Code 1 imposed death
by stoning as a possible punishment for
conduct that should not be criminal, such as
extramarital sexual relations and consensual
sex between people of the same gender, as
well as for offences such as theft and rape.
It also allowed for the imposition of the death
penalty for child offenders and for offences
such as mocking the Prophet Muhammad.
However, while Brunei Darussalam retained
the death penalty in law, it remained
abolitionist in practice.

TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Brunei Darussalam has not ratified the UN
Convention against Torture. The country’s
new Penal Code significantly expanded the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15scope of corporal punishments that amount
or could amount to torture (including death
by stoning – see above).
A wide range of offences including theft
were punishable by whipping or amputation.
Judicial caning remained a common
punishment for crimes including possession
of drugs and immigration offences. At least
three caning sentences were known to have
been carried out in 2014. Under existing law,
children could be sentenced to whipping;
under the revised Penal Code children could
also be sentenced to amputations. The Penal
Code also introduced laws discriminating
against women, including punishing abortion
with public flogging. BULGARIA
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION In July, the government coalition headed
by the Bulgarian Socialist Party resigned
following heavy losses in the European
Parliament elections. Its year in power had
been plagued by protests against government
corruption and backroom dealing sparked
by the controversial appointment of Delyan
Peevski, a prominent media mogul and MP,
as head of the Bulgarian Security Agency.
New parliamentary elections were set for
October 2014, less than 18 months after the
previous round, which was also prompted by
the resignation of the government. Following
the elections, a new government under Prime
Minister Boyko Borisov from the GERB party
was appointed in November.
Journalists continued to be censored. In
February, the Sultan ordered a halt to
criticism of the new Penal Code.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
The Constitution protects non-Muslims’
right to practise their religion, but laws and
policies restricted this right for Muslims and
non-Muslims alike. The revised Penal Code
criminalized exposing Muslim children to the
beliefs and practices of any religion other
than Islam.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The Internal Security Act (ISA) permitted
detention without trial for indefinitely
renewable two-year periods, and was used
to detain anti-government activists. An
Indonesian detained without trial under the
ISA since February was initially refused visits
by his embassy for two months.

Republic of Bulgaria
Head of state: Rosen Plevneliev
Head of government: Boyko Borisov (replaced
Georgi Bliznashki in November)
The reception conditions for asylum-seekers
entering Bulgaria partially improved but
concerns remained over access to Bulgarian
territory and the integration of refugees.
Prevention and investigation of hate crimes
by the authorities was inadequate.
BACKGROUND
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In August 2013, Bulgaria experienced a large
increase in the number of refugees, asylum-
seekers and migrants entering the country
irregularly. By the end of 2013 over 11,000
people, many of them refugees from Syria,
had crossed the border, compared to a total
of 1,700 in 2012.
The Bulgarian authorities initially struggled
to respond adequately. Hundreds of people
in need of international protection ended up
living for months in substandard conditions
without access to asylum procedures. In
January 2014, UNHCR, the UN refugee
87agency, stated that asylum-seekers in
Bulgaria faced a real risk of inhuman
and degrading treatment due to systemic
deficiencies in the Bulgarian asylum and
reception system. It called on the EU Member
States to suspend transfers of asylum-seekers
back to Bulgaria. 1 The reception conditions
for new arrivals improved, thanks in large
measure to EU and bilateral assistance.
In April, UNHCR reviewed the situation in
Bulgaria and found that despite progress
made by the authorities, serious shortcomings
remained. It lifted its call for the general
suspension of transfers with the exception
of certain groups, especially those with
special needs.
The number of refugees and migrants
dropped dramatically in 2014, to 3,966 by
October as a result of a government policy
adopted in November 2013 that aimed to
decrease the number of people irregularly
entering Bulgaria. A number of NGOs,
including Amnesty International, documented
violations including unlawful expulsions of
people back to Turkey (push-backs) without
giving them a chance to seek asylum, which
the authorities strenuously denied. An
official investigation was initiated only in one
such case.
Integration of refugees
Recognized refugees faced problems in
accessing education, housing, health care
and other public services. In August, the
government rejected a plan prepared by the
State Agency for Refugees and the Ministry
of Labour for the implementation of the
National Integration Strategy adopted earlier
in the year.
According to the State Agency for
Refugees, in September only 98 out of 520
registered refugee children were enrolled in
school. This was due to the Schools Act which
requires any new pupil to pass an exam in
the Bulgarian language and in other subjects.
A draft Law on Asylum and Refugees, which
was intended to ensure unhindered access to
primary education for refugee children, was
not adopted due to the fall of the government.
88
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
A prominent human rights NGO, the
Bulgarian Helsinki Committee (BHC), faced
a tax inspection as well as harassment by far
right groups. These were seen as intimidatory
since the BHC is known for its criticism of
the government’s human rights record, in
particular the treatment of asylum-seekers
and the failure to prevent and address hate
crimes. In January, prompted by a request
by VMRO-BND, an ultra-nationalist political
party, the National Revenue Agency carried
out a large-scale audit of the BHC’s finances
for the period 2007-2012. The audit did not
establish any breach.
On 12 September, a far right political party,
the Bulgarian National Union, organized a
rally under the slogan “Let’s ban BHC!” The
rally concluded outside the offices of the
BHC, where participants verbally abused
staff and visitors. They reportedly also called
for the banning of all NGOs in Bulgaria. The
police officers present at the rally did not
intervene to prevent or stop the harassment
and verbal assaults. In November, in
communication with Amnesty International,
the Ministry of Interior denied any harassment
or intimidation of BHC staff or visitors during
the protest.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Concerns remained regarding the
effectiveness and independence of
investigations into allegations of police
ill-treatment. Investigations into several
allegations of the excessive use of force by
police during the protests in the capital, Sofia,
in June 2013 were still ongoing by the end of
2014. 2
HATE CRIMES AGAINST ETHNIC
MINORITIES AND MIGRANTS
In the second half of 2013, many violent
attacks targeting ethnic and religious
minorities, including migrants, refugees and
asylum-seekers, were reported by the media
and NGOs, exposing shortcomings in the
prevention and investigation of such hate
Amnesty International Report 2014/15crimes. 3 In March, the European Court of
Human Rights found in Abdu v. Bulgaria that
authorities had failed to thoroughly investigate
the racist motive associated with the physical
assault of a Sudanese national in 2003.
Between July and September, Amnesty
International researched 16 cases of
alleged hate crimes against individuals and
properties. The hate motive was investigated
only in one of them.
Legislative gaps regarding hate crimes
on other protected grounds, such as sexual
orientation, gender identity or disability,
persisted. In January, the government
proposed a draft new Criminal Code closing
some of these gaps, but it had not been
adopted by the end of the year.

BURKINA FASO
Burkina Faso
Head of state: Michel Kafando (replaced Blaise
Compaoré in November)
Head of government: Yacouba Isaac Zida (replaced
Luc Adolphe Tiao in November)
Concerns remained over the use of torture
and other ill-treatment and excessive force
by police and other security personnel. High
levels of maternal mortality persisted.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
President Compaoré resigned at the end of
October following widespread protests against
a bill proposing constitutional amendments
that would allow him to run for re-election
in 2015. Following the bill’s withdrawal,
a transitional government led by interim
President Michel Kafando was sworn in
in November to steer the country towards
legislative and presidential elections.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In October, following a riot at MACO prison
in Ouagadougou, at least 11 prisoners were
repeatedly beaten and otherwise ill-treated by
prison guards and accused of organizing an
escape attempt. Two prisoners died following
the riot, reportedly as a result of dehydration
and lack of ventilation in their cell during
a lockdown.
More than 30 prisoners alleged that they
had been tortured and otherwise ill-treated
at the time of arrest, and while being held
in gendarmerie (military police) detention
centres and police stations around the
country in 2013 and 2014. One detainee
described being tortured for a period of 17
days at the central Ouagadougou police
station; his hands were handcuffed to his
ankles, an iron bar was put underneath his
knees and he was suspended in a squatting
position between two tables. Other detainees
also said they were beaten and forced
to sign statements without knowledge of
their content.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
During protests in October and November,
security forces used excessive, sometimes
lethal, force against peaceful protesters,
resulting in at least 10 deaths with hundreds
more injured.
On 30 and 31 October, prison guards and
gendarmes used excessive and lethal force
to repress a prison riot and attempted escape
at the MACO prison in Ouagadougou. Three
prisoners were shot dead.
89RIGHT TO HEALTH –
MATERNAL MORTALITY
Concerns about high levels of maternal
deaths remained. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimated that 2,800
women died during or following childbirth in
2013. WHO also reported a persistently high
unmet need for contraception information,
services and goods.
The Ministry of Health, working with
the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and
other agencies, launched the first National
Family Planning Week in 2013 aimed at
raising awareness about contraception
and challenging persistent negative
stereotypes about women and girls who take
contraception.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In a ruling in March, the African Court on
Human and Peoples’ Rights held that the
Burkinabé state – in its failure to diligently
investigate and bring to justice those
responsible for the assassination of journalist
Norbert Zongo and three of his companions,
found burned to death in a car in 1998 – had
violated the right to freedom of expression by
causing “fear and worry in media circles”.
In another ruling in December, in the case
of Konaté v. Burkina Faso, the Court ruled
that imprisonment for defamation violated
the right to freedom of expression while
criminal defamation laws should be used
only in limited circumstances. The Court
ordered Burkina Faso to change its criminal
defamation laws.
BURUNDI
Republic of Burundi
Head of state and government: Pierre Nkurunziza
Government repression of critical voices
intensified during the year. Violations of the
90
rights to freedom of expression, association
and peaceful assembly increased. Members
of the opposition, civil society activists,
lawyers and journalists were among those
who faced heightened restrictions as the
2015 elections approached. Meetings and
marches were not allowed to take place.
Allegations of harassment and violence
committed by members of the ruling
party’s youth wing, Imbonerakure, were not
effectively investigated.
BACKGROUND
Political tensions ran high as President
Nkurunziza looked set to stand for a third
term, a move perceived by many as a
violation of Burundi’s Constitution. In March,
the National Assembly narrowly rejected a bill
proposing constitutional amendments that
would have allowed the President to stand for
a further term. Official statements indicated
that the Constitutional Court would rule on
the issue at a later date. Critics accused
the ruling National Council for the Defense
of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD-FDD) of jeopardizing
ethnic power-sharing principles agreed in
Burundi’s post-conflict Arusha Accord.
The United Nations Office in Burundi
(BNUB), established in January 2011, closed
at the end of 2014.
Strong criticism of the civil and political
rights situation in Burundi was made by UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, the African
Union (AU) and some donor countries,
including France and the USA.
FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION
AND EXPRESSION
The authorities refused to grant opposition
groups, the press, the Burundian Bar
Association and civil society organizations
authorization to hold legitimate meetings and
peaceful demonstrations. 1
For example, in February, the Mayor of
Bujumbura prevented the Burundian Bar
Association from holding its General Assembly
Amnesty International Report 2014/15and another planned training workshop. In
March, youth members of the Movement for
Solidarity and Democracy (MSD) were denied
permission to hold a meeting at a local centre
in the commune of Gihosha, Bujumbura,
to discuss the proposed amendments to
the Constitution. The authorities gave no
explanation for their decision.
Political figures and opposition parties were
subject to official interference, harassment
and arbitrary arrest. For example, irregular
arrest and trial proceedings in relation to
corruption allegations against Frédéric
Bamvuginyumvira limited his political
activities. He was released from detention in
March on health grounds.
Repressive legislation
The Press Law, promulgated in June 2013,
provided for official restriction of press
activities and freedom of expression. The law
stipulates that journalists can be required to
reveal their sources on a number of issues
from public order to state security.
The Law on Public Gatherings was used
to arbitrarily deny opposition groups and civil
society permission to meet publicly or hold
demonstrations.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Members of civil society organizations and the
media, especially those working on potentially
sensitive subjects relating to human rights
or state accountability, were subject
to harassment.
Leading human rights defender and
prisoner of conscience Pierre Claver
Mbonimpa was detained in May and charged
with threatening state security and using
false documents. He was arrested shortly
after his comment that young men were
receiving arms and uniforms and travelling
to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of
the Congo for military training was broadcast
on the radio. He was provisionally released
on medical grounds in September. His
imprisonment sent a chilling signal to the rest
of civil society that individuals reporting on
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
sensitive subjects would be at risk of arbitrary
arrest. 2
In April, a march organized by civil
society organizations to commemorate
the fifth anniversary of the killing of Ernest
Manirumva, Vice-President of the Anti-
corruption and Economic Malpractice
Observatory (OLUCOME), was prevented from
going ahead. At the time when the march
should have taken place, the Prosecutor
General issued a statement claiming
that the prosecution had incriminating
evidence linking Gabriel Rufyiri, President of
OLUCOME, to the death of Ernest Manirumva.
No investigation had been initiated into
the alleged involvement of several high-
ranking members of the security services in
the killing.
IMPUNITY
Human rights abuses by Imbonerakure
Members of Imbonerakure, the youth wing
of the CNDD-FDD, committed human rights
abuses on the pretext of maintaining security.
They prevented opposition party meetings
and intimidated, attacked and even killed
members of the opposition with impunity.
On 14 March, Ananias Nsabaganwa,
a member of the Front for Democracy in
Burundi, was visited at his home in the
Commune of Busoni, Kirundo Province,
by two local administrative officials, three
members of Imbonerakure (including the
head of Nyagisozi zone) and two soldiers.
He was reportedly shot dead by one of the
soldiers on the orders of one of the local
officials and an Imbonerakure member.
In April, a leaked internal cable sent by
the BNUB reported that in one province
two members of the military had supplied
Imbonerakure and demobilized soldiers with
weapons and military and police uniforms.
The government denied these allegations but
took no steps to investigate them.
Extrajudicial executions
Most allegations of politically motivated
killings carried out between 2010 and 2012
were not investigated. Victims and witnesses
91remained at risk because of the lack of
effective protection mechanisms.
The African Commission on Human and
Peoples’ Rights agreed in June to consider a
complaint from civil society groups and Track
Impunity Always (TRIAL) in relation to four
cases of extrajudicial executions. CAMBODIA
JUSTICE SYSTEM Respect for the right to freedoms of
expression, association and assembly
deteriorated with a seven months’ ban on
public gatherings. The authorities used
excessive force against peaceful protesters,
resulting in deaths and injuries. Human
rights defenders and political activists
faced threats, harassment, prosecution
and sometimes violence. Impunity for
perpetrators of human rights abuses
persisted, with no thorough, impartial and
independent investigations into killings
and beatings. Two further convictions at
the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts
of Cambodia for crimes against humanity
during the Khmer Rouge period resulted in
life sentences; a second trial against the
same defendants was ongoing. Thousands of
people affected by land grabbing by private
companies for development and agro-
industry faced forced eviction and loss of
land, housing and livelihood.
The justice system lacked material, financial
and logistical resources. Generalized
problems were regularly cited in relation
to the judiciary including a heavy backlog
of cases, a lack of transport to transfer
suspects from detention facilities to court
and cases not being opened or prepared
for court by prosecutors. There were also
reports of corruption within the judiciary and
the authorities continued to fail to effectively
investigate politically sensitive cases.
TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION
COMMISSION
On 15 May, a law establishing a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was
passed. The law failed to include clear
language on the setting up of a special
tribunal to prosecute individuals responsible
for crimes under international law, including
war crimes and crimes against humanity. The
TRC officially began on 10 December 2014 as
11 Commissioners were sworn into office.

Kingdom of Cambodia
Head of state: King Norodom Sihamoni
Head of government:Hun Sen
BACKGROUND
In July the opposition Cambodian National
Rescue Party (CNRP) ended its year-long
boycott of the National Assembly following an
agreement with Prime Minister Hun Sen and
his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP)
over electoral reform. The opposition, which
won 55 out of 123 seats in the July 2013
national elections, had alleged electoral fraud
favouring the CPP.
Two new laws – the Law on the
Organization of the Courts and the Law on
the Status of Judges and Prosecutors – were
enacted in July, along with an amended
Law on the Organization and Functioning
of the Supreme Council of Magistracy. The
laws gave excessive powers over judges and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15prosecutors to the Ministry of Justice and the
Supreme Council of Magistracy, contrary to
international standards.
Amid widespread criticism from human
rights and refugee organizations, including
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, Cambodia
signed a controversial Memorandum of
Understanding with Australia in September
to accept an unknown number of recognized
refugees relocated from the Pacific island of
Nauru. Australia undertook to fund the costs
of relocation and services for the refugees
for one year in Cambodia and to provide
additional aid worth US$40 million over a
four-year period.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Security forces used excessive force to
respond to peaceful assemblies, leading to
deaths and injuries. On 2 January, 10 men,
including four human rights defenders, were
beaten with wooden sticks and metal bars
and then arrested during a violent operation
by soldiers in response to mostly peaceful
protests by striking garment factory workers.
The following day, four men were shot
dead and 21 others injured when security
forces fired live ammunition during violent
clashes with striking garment workers
and others in the Pur Senchey district of
the capital, Phnom Penh. Although some
protesters threw rocks, no threat was posed
to the lives of security forces or others. The
use of live ammunition appeared to be an
unnecessary response and was therefore in
violation of international standards. Dozens
of people were hospitalized, including many
with bullet wounds. Teenagers were among
the casualties; Khem Saphath, a 16-year-old
youth, was last seen with a gunshot wound
and was presumed to have died. 1
District security guards and plain-clothed
men were deployed to break up peaceful
demonstrations in Phnom Penh throughout
the year. They used weapons including sticks,
wooden batons, metal bars, electroshock
weapons and slingshots. Human rights
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
monitors and journalists were among those
specifically targeted and beaten.
In June Cambodia rejected
recommendations by states participating in
the review of the government’s human rights
record under the UN Human Rights Council’s
Universal Periodic Review to investigate the
use of excessive force against protesters and
killings during demonstrations and to end
impunity for such abuses. No one was held
accountable for any of the deaths or injuries
sustained. 2
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
On 5 January, the Ministry of Interior
announced that demonstrations “must be
provisionally suspended” following a three-
day crackdown on protests that resulted in
at least four deaths and 23 arrests. Official
requests from individuals and groups for
permission to hold gatherings in Phnom Penh
were repeatedly rejected. In April, Phnom
Penh’s Freedom Park – an area designated
for peaceful assembly under the Law on
Peaceful Demonstrations – was barricaded
with barbed wire. Those who tried to gather
despite the ban were violently dispersed
by security forces. Restrictions on peaceful
assembly were loosened and Freedom Park
reopened in August following a political
agreement reached between the government
and opposition party.
In addition to the 10 men arrested on 2
January, another 13 workers were arrested on
3 January during the lethal clashes in Phnom
Penh’s Pur Senchey district. Some of the 23
arrested were severely beaten by security
forces and denied access to medical care.
All were charged with intentional violence
and other crimes and detained. They were
convicted in May following trials regarded by
local observers as unfair; their sentences were
suspended and all were released.
Eight officials of the opposition CNRP
were arrested and charged with leading
an “insurrection” following a violent clash
between some CNRP supporters and district
security guards at an attempted peaceful
93gathering at Freedom Park in July. They
were all released a week later as the political
agreement was reached. However, 10 youth
activists and one CNRP official, five of whom
were in pre-trial detention, were subsequently
summoned for trial on 25 December on
charges of “insurrection”; the trial was
adjourned until January 2015. Legal action
was initiated in September against six trade
union leaders for “incitement”. Although
they were not detained, the court issued
supervision orders, meaning they could not
take part in or organize protests.
In November, seven women housing rights
defenders from the Boeung Kak community
were imprisoned for a year after a summary
trial for taking part in a peaceful street protest.
Three other women and a Buddhist monk
were also imprisoned for calling for their
release outside the court. 3
Meetings and forums elsewhere in
the country were also prevented by
local authorities. In March and June the
Cambodian Youth Network attempted to hold
training sessions in Kampong Thom province
on human rights issues, including illegal
logging, but the sessions were disrupted by
armed police. In June a planned public forum
on illegal logging in Preah Vihear province
was also banned.
LAND DISPUTES
Conflicts over land continued, with
disputes over land grabbing, forced
evictions, Economic Land Concessions and
environmental concerns. This led to increased
protests and confrontations, often involving
local authorities and private companies.
In April, local rights group the Cambodian
League for the Promotion and Defense of
Human Rights (LICADHO) estimated that the
total number of people affected since 2000
by land grabbing and forced evictions in 13
provinces monitored – about half the country
– had passed half a million.
Land disputes remained unresolved,
leaving thousands either without adequate
housing and land, and therefore unable to
94
make a living, or at risk of forced eviction.
In March, the Cambodian Human Rights
and Development Association (ADHOC)
re-submitted complaints to the relevant
authorities on behalf of around 11,000
families involved in protracted disputes, some
lasting more than 10 years. The families came
from 105 communities in 17 of Cambodia’s
25 provinces.
Despite numerous promises from the
authorities to find a solution, more than
100 out of 300 families forcibly evicted
from Borei Keila in Phnom Penh in January
2012 remained homeless and living in
harsh conditions.
In October a group of international
law experts provided information to the
ICC on behalf of 10 victims alleging that
“widespread and systematic” land grabbing
by the Cambodian government was a crime
against humanity.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
In August, Nuon Chea, 88, the former
second-in-command of the Khmer Rouge
regime, and Khieu Samphan, 83, the
former head of state, were sentenced to life
imprisonment by the Extraordinary Chambers
in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC, Khmer
Rouge tribunal). They were convicted of
the forced movement of the population
from Phnom Penh and elsewhere, and
the execution of soldiers from the Khmer
Republic, the regime toppled by the Khmer
Rouge. Both appealed the sentences. Eleven
reparation projects designed by victims with
external funding were also endorsed by
the ECCC.
Case 002/02 against the two men began in
October focusing on alleged crimes against
humanity at agricultural co-operatives and a
security centre in Takeo province.

Republic of Cameroon
Head of state: Paul Biya
Head of government: Philémon Yang
Freedoms of association and assembly
continued to be restricted. Human rights
defenders were frequently intimidated
and harassed by government security
agents. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and intersex people continued to face
discrimination, intimidation, harassment
and other forms of attacks. The Nigerian
Islamist armed group Boko Haram stepped
up attacks in the northeastern region of
Cameroon, including killings, burning
villages and hostage-taking. Arbitrary
arrests, detentions and extrajudicial
executions of people suspected of being
members of Boko Haram were reportedly
carried out by security agents. Hundreds
of thousands of refugees from Nigeria and
the Central African Republic were living in
crowded refugee camps in dire conditions.
BACKGROUND
There were signs of instability across the
country as a result of internal political
tensions and external developments,
including ongoing cross-border attacks by
Boko Haram, and violence in neighbouring
Central African Republic (CAR). Security
forces including the Rapid Intervention
Brigade (BIR) were responsible for human
rights violations including killings, extrajudicial
executions, enforced disappearances,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS
A number of people suspected of being
linked to Boko Haram were allegedly killed
by security forces, including by members of
the BIR, in northern Cameroon. On 1 June,
nurse Nzouane Clair René was shot dead
near the town of Mora, following arrest by
security forces. On the same day, Ousmane
Djibrine and Gréma Abakar, traders travelling
to a village market in Zigagué, were reportedly
killed by BIR members in the village of
Dabanga. On 15 June Malloum Abba was
killed by BIR members in the village of
Tolkomari. On 20 June Oumaté Kola was
reportedly found shot dead in the Mozogo
forest following his arrest by BIR members a
few days earlier. The same day, Boukar Madjo
was shot dead, allegedly by BIR members, in
the town of Nguetchewé.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Several cases of enforced disappearance
were reported, especially in the extreme north
of the country where security forces were
fighting Boko Haram. Most of the reported
cases were allegedly committed by members
of the BIR.
On 2 June, Abakar Kamsouloum was
reportedly arrested by security forces at his
home in Kousseri and transferred to a military
camp. His fate and whereabouts remained
unknown to his family and local civil society
organizations at the end of the year, despite
several requests for information to the local
authorities.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Boko Haram was responsible for human
rights abuses, especially in the northeastern
region. Houses were burned and a number
of people were killed during raids on
villages, often in punitive attacks for real or
perceived co-operation with Cameroonian
security forces.
95Boko Haram fighters conducted several
abductions in Cameroon during the year.
Some of those abducted were released,
reportedly often after payment of a ransom
by the government. The authorities continued
to refute this allegation. On 27 July, the
residence of Cameroonian Vice-Prime
Minister Amadou Ali was attacked by Boko
Haram members in the village of Kolofata,
close to the Nigerian border. Seventeen
people were abducted including the Vice-
Prime Minister’s wife. Several others including
police officers were killed during the attack.
All those abducted were released in October
together with 10 Chinese workers who were
abducted in May.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Thousands of refugees were living in dire
conditions in crowded camps in border areas
after fleeing violence in the CAR and Nigeria.
At the end of the year there were around
40,000 refugees from Nigeria and some
238,517 from the CAR in the country. At least
130,000 refugees from the CAR crossed into
Cameroon following violence that erupted in
the CAR between the Séléka and Anti-balaka
armed groups in December 2013. Conditions
were difficult in the camps and attacks
on camps by unidentified armed groups
were reported. These attacks led UNHCR,
the UN refugee agency, to move refugees
from border areas to more secure places
within Cameroon.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Discrimination, intimidation, harassment
and violence directed towards LGBTI
people remained of serious concern. LGBTI
individuals, mostly men but also women, were
arrested for alleged same-sex sexual activity.
Some of those arrested were sentenced to
prison terms of up to five years. Others were
arbitrarily detained and later released.
On 1 October, five people, including one
transgendered person, were arrested after
police raided a home in the capital Yaoundé.
96
They were later detained at a nearby police
station and a sixth person was also detained
when he visited those already in detention.
Two of those arrested were released the
same day. The other four were charged with
prostitution and “disturbance” and remained
in detention until 7 October, when they were
released pending an investigation.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders and groups were
frequently intimidated, harassed and
threatened. Offices of some human rights
organizations were placed under surveillance
and at times attacked, allegedly by
security agents.
On the night of 12 June, the premises of
the Central Africa Human Rights Defenders’
Network (REDHAC) were burgled by a
group of eight unidentified armed men.
They threatened to kill the guard before
forcing their way into the offices, searching
through documents and reportedly taking
two television sets, three laptops, an iPad
and some money. The incident was the
fourth time REDHAC’s offices had been
attacked, but despite the organization lodging
complaints with the police, no concrete
measure was taken by the authorities to
effectively and fully investigate the incidents.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
People continued to be arrested and detained
without charge by security forces including
by members of the BIR in the context of
its operation against Boko Haram in the
northern regions. There were several cases
of people being detained incommunicado. In
most cases, detainees were prevented from
receiving visits from family members, doctors
or lawyers. There were also several reported
cases of people being arbitrarily arrested and
detained by the police and gendarmerie for
civil matters, contrary to provisions of the
Constitution and domestic legislation.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION
AND ASSEMBLY
Perceived or actual opponents of the
government continued to be denied the
right to organize peaceful activities and
demonstrations.
On 3 October, reggae singer Joe de Vinci
Kameni, known as Joe La Conscience,
was arrested by police outside the French
consulate in Douala as he was preparing
to start a peaceful demonstration. A local
journalist was arrested alongside him and
later released. Joe de Vinci Kameni was
released on 9 October without charge.

Canada
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Governor General David Johnston
Head of government: Stephen Harper
There were systematic violations of the
rights of Indigenous Peoples. Attacks
against two Canadian soldiers provoked
a debate about terrorism and national
security laws.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
In February, the government rejected a
proposed mine in the traditional territory
of the Tsilhqot’in people in the province of
British Columbia, which an environmental
assessment concluded would cause
irreversible and profound harm to Tsilhqot’in
culture and society. 1 However, the federal
government gave resource development
precedence over Indigenous rights in a
series of other large-scale projects, including
the Northern Gateway oil sands pipeline,
approved in June, and the Site C dam
megaproject, approved in October.
In May, the UN Special Rapporteur on
the rights of Indigenous Peoples reported
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
that the situation of Indigenous Peoples in
Canada had reached “crisis proportions
in many respects”, including “distressing
socio-economic conditions” and a
disproportionately high number of Indigenous
people in prison.
In June, the Supreme Court for the first
time recognized an Indigenous nation’s pre-
colonial land title, upholding the right of the
Tsilhqot’in to own and manage a large part of
their traditional territories.
In September, Canada was the only
state to take issue with part of the UN
World Conference on Indigenous Peoples’
outcome document.
In October, the Canadian Human Rights
Tribunal heard concluding arguments in a
case alleging discriminatory federal under-
funding of child protection in First Nation
Indigenous communities.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
In May, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
reported that at least 1,017 Indigenous
women and girls were murdered between
1980 and 2012, four and a half times the
homicide rate for all other women. Despite
mounting demands, including by provincial
and territorial governments, the federal
government refused to initiate a national
action plan or public inquiry.
In November, separate allegations of
sexual assault and/or harassment against a
radio host and two Members of Parliament
sparked a national debate about violence
against women.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
In January, it was revealed that a national
security agency, Communications Security
Establishment Canada, had monitored
thousands of travellers’ electronic devices
at a major airport and for days after they left
the airport.
In May, the Supreme Court ruled that using
Special Advocates in “immigration security
certificate” hearings provided a fair process
even though they were generally barred
97from communicating with the individuals
concerned after accessing secret evidence.
In June, the Citizenship Act was reformed,
allowing dual nationals convicted of terrorism
and some other offences to be stripped of
Canadian citizenship. There were concerns
about dual tiers of citizenship and unfairness
in the revocation procedure.
In July, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled
that Omar Khadr should be treated as a
juvenile offender. He was apprehended by US
forces in Afghanistan when he was 15 years
old and held for 10 years at the US detention
centre at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba until his
transfer to Canada in 2012 to complete his
prison sentence.
In October, two Canadian soldiers were
killed in separate attacks; Patrice Vincent
in St-Jean-Sur-Richelieu and Nathan Cirillo
in Ottawa. The gunman who killed Nathan
Cirillo then entered the Canadian Parliament
and was killed by security officers. The
government subsequently proposed law
reforms to increase the powers of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
The bill did not address concerns about
inadequate national security oversight.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In July, the Federal Court ruled that cuts
to the Interim Federal Health Program for
refugees were unconstitutional.
In October, the government proposed
legislation allowing for provincial and territorial
governments to deny social assistance to
refugee claimants.
Also in October, a coroner’s inquest into
the 2013 death by hanging of Mexican
national Lucía Vega Jiménez in a Vancouver
airport holding cell recommended changes to
immigration detention.
There were concerns about the
low numbers of Syrian refugees given
resettlement places in Canada.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION

protests in 2012, including policing tactics.
The Quebec government rejected the
Commission’s recommendations.
Numerous civil society organizations that
criticized government policies were targeted
for audits related to their charitable tax status
and the permissibility of their advocacy work.
There were concerning disclosures about
police surveillance of Indigenous land rights
activists, including sharing the information
with corporations.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
In October, the Supreme Court upheld the
State Immunity Act, barring the family of
Zahra Kazemi, a Canadian/Iranian national
who was tortured and died in Iranian custody
in 2003, from bringing a lawsuit against Iran
in Canada.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
In May, the third annual report assessing the
human rights impact of the Canada-Colombia
Free Trade Agreement was released. It failed
to consider significant human rights concerns
facing Indigenous Peoples in Colombia.
Lawsuits alleging human rights abuses
were filed against Canadian mining
companies Tahoe Resources in June
and Nevsun Resources in November, in
connection with their operations in Colombia
and Eritrea respectively.
In November, changes to the Office of
the Extractives Sector Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) Counsellor fell short
of calls for an Ombudsperson with power
to investigate companies and recommend
sanctions and remedies for non-compliance.
Corporate participation in the complaints
process remained voluntary, although
companies faced withdrawals of certain
government services if they did not respect
Canada’s CSR strategy.

CENTRAL AFRICAN
REPUBLIC
Central African Republic
Head of state: Catherine Samba-Panza
Head of government: Mahamat Kamoun
Crimes under international law such as
war crimes and crimes against humanity
were regularly committed, including
killings, mutilation of bodies, abductions,
recruitment and use of child soldiers and
forced displacement of populations. In
December 2013 a coalition of the mainly
Christian and animist anti-Balaka armed
groups attacked the capital Bangui and the
mostly Muslim Séléka forces retaliated,
killing dozens of civilians. The United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINUSCA) – which replaced the
African-led International Support Mission
to the Central African Republic (MISCA)
in September 2014 – has not stopped or
prevented abuses in the region. Many of
those suspected of criminal responsibility,
including commanders of the Séléka,
anti-Balaka, and their allies, have not been
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
investigated or arrested and no action has
been taken to bring them to justice.
BACKGROUND
Violence continued in the Central African
Republic (CAR) despite the deployment
of MINUSCA, in September 2014, and
the presence of French forces (known
as Sangaris) and European Union forces
(EUFOR). Deadly attacks against civilians,
including on those in sites for internally
displaced persons (IDP), by the anti-Balaka,
Séléka and armed Peulh fighters (members of
the Peulh ethnic group) continued. According
to the UN, in mid-November, 7,451 military
and 1,083 police personnel had been
deployed to MINUSCA.
On 10 January, Séléka leader and CAR
President Michel Djotodia resigned following
pressure from the international community
and CAR civil society organizations. Catherine
Samba-Panza was sworn in as the new
Transitional President on 23 January.
On 7 February 2014 the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) announced
a new preliminary examination into crimes
allegedly committed in the CAR since
September 2012. In September, the Office of
the Prosecutor announced its conclusion that
there was a reasonable basis for investigating
crimes defined under the Rome Statute
committed in CAR since September 2012.
On 11 July, a Séléka congress designated
former President Djotodia and former
commander and Minister Nourredine Adam
as the group’s president and vice-president
respectively. Those two individuals are
under UN and US sanctions for their alleged
involvement in human rights violations
and abuses.
Prime Minister André Nzapayéké and
his entire cabinet resigned following the
ceasefire agreement signed in July 2014 in
Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, by armed
groups' representatives, political parties,
churches and civil society organizations. On
22 August, Transitional President Samba-
99Panza appointed the new Prime Minister
Mahamat Kamoun.
On 7 August, a memorandum of
understanding was signed between MINUSCA
and the government to “establish a Special
Jurisdiction created by national legislation, in
which international judicial and prosecutorial
executive functions would be attached to a
national judicial body”. However, legislation
for the “Special Criminal Court” has yet to be
passed and no funding has been provided.
Fresh violence erupted in the capital
Bangui in mid-October. A series of violent
incidents occurred in Bangui, with MINUSCA
forces facing protests and attacks. At least
a dozen people were killed and thousands
were forced to flee and live in camps for
IDPs. Escalating violence by the Séléka,
armed Peulh fighters and anti-Balaka was
observed in the central region, especially
around the city of Bambari. On 9 October
2014, a MINUSCA convoy was attacked
leaving one peacekeeper dead, another
severely wounded, and seven others injured.
Sporadic clashes between anti-Balaka fighters
and international forces, including EUFOR,
continued. According to UNHCR, the October
violence displaced some 6,500 people in
Bangui, but that number could be higher.
As of October 2014 there were 410,000
IDPs and some 420,000 people had fled to
neighbouring countries.
On 29 October, the UN Panel of Experts
on CAR released its final report which
highlighted credible evidence of crimes under
international law committed by armed groups.
It also referred to the exploitation of natural
resources by armed groups; the illicit transfer
of arms and ammunition; arms proliferation;
and violations of international humanitarian
law, including attacks on schools and
hospitals, sexual violence and the use of
child soldiers.
By the end of 2014, anti-Balaka and
Séléka groups lacked co-ordination, leading
to the creation of various other groups among
them. The mostly Muslim Séléka forces
clashed with the mainly Christian and animist
100
anti-Balaka militia. All sides systematically
targeted civilians believed to support the other
side’s fighters.
On 10 December, MINUSCA announced
that it had arrested Abdel Kader “Baba
Ladde”, leader of the Chadian armed group
Popular Front for Recovery near Kabo at the
border with Chad. Baba Ladde and members
of his armed group had been accused of
attacking civilians in northern CAR and
recruiting child soldiers.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Abuses by Séléka
Séléka forces were allegedly responsible
for serious human rights abuses, including
killings, burning houses and villages
mostly belonging to Christians, forced
displacement of the populations and enforced
disappearances. Christian communities
frequently attributed responsibility for Séléka’s
abuses to the country’s Muslim minority; acts
of retaliation were reported and the already
serious sectarian divisions deepened. No
effective investigations were conducted into
most incidents.
On 22 January, more than 100 Christian
civilians including children were allegedly
killed by Séléka fighters and armed Muslim
civilians in Baoro. On 17 April, Father
Wilibona was allegedly killed by Séléka and
armed Peulh fighters after being ambushed at
Tale village. On 26 April, 16 people, including
13 local leaders and three aid workers from
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), were killed
by a Séléka group, prompting MSF to reduce
its CAR activities. On 7 July, 26 people were
killed and 35 seriously wounded during an
attack at a church and IDP site in Bambari.
More than 10,000 people fled. On 1 October,
Séléka fighters attacked an IDP camp next
to the MINUSCA base in Bambari (which
accommodated Christian and animist IDPs).
Several people were killed. On 10 October,
Séléka fighters attacked an IDP site in the
Catholic Church compound in Dekoa. Nine
Amnesty International Report 2014/15civilians including a pregnant woman were
killed and several wounded.
Abductions by Séléka
In April, the Séléka in Batangafo abducted
a bishop and three priests. They were later
released following negotiation between the
authorities, the Catholic Church and Séléka
commanders. Those allegedly responsible
for the abduction were identifiable but no
investigation was opened.
Abuses by the anti-Balaka
Anti-Balaka armed group members were
responsible for war crimes and crimes against
humanity. They were the main perpetrators of
abuses committed against Muslims in Bangui
and in western CAR, especially following the
former President’s resignation in January
2014, and the retreat of most Séléka forces to
the northeastern region.
Since 8 January 2014, a series of deadly
attacks on Muslims were carried out across
western CAR. Some attacks were allegedly
carried out in revenge for the previous killing
of Christians by Séléka forces and armed
Muslims. On 16 January, 20 civilians were
killed and dozens injured outside the town
of Bouar, when their vehicle was attacked
by anti-Balaka militias. Some victims were
hacked to death with machetes, others were
shot. Among the victims was an 11-year-old
girl. On 14 January, after stopping a truck in
Boyali and demanding the Muslims get off,
anti-Balaka fighters killed six members of a
family: three women and three small children,
aged one, three, and five. On 18 January,
at least 100 Muslims were killed in the town
of Bossemptele. Two days later, anti-Balaka
fighters killed four Muslim women who had
hidden in a Christian family’s house. On 29
September, Abdou Salam Zaiko, a Muslim
from Bambari, was killed when the vehicle
he was travelling in was attacked. According
to witnesses, the anti-Balaka allowed the
Christian driver and passengers to leave the
vehicle, but killed Zaiko and other Muslim
passengers. On 8 October, seven Muslim
passengers in a car owned by Saidu Daouda
were killed after the car was ambushed. On
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
14 October, in the Bangui neighbourhood of
Nguingo, anti-Balaka members killed three
civilians, seriously injured at least 20 more,
and burned down 28 houses and a church.
The attack was revenge for an earlier assault
on some of their members by the local
population following a previous attack by
the armed group. Over 1,000 people fled to
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)’s
Equator province, while 100 took refuge at a
Catholic Church compound. In September,
Djimbété encampment for the Peulh ethnic
group was attacked. Several people were
killed including a six-year old boy.
Abuses committed by armed Peulh fighters
Armed Muslim Peulh fighters who were often
allies of the Séléka conducted attacks killing
and injuring mainly Christians, pillaging and
burning villages and houses. In October,
armed Muslim Peulh fighters allegedly
carried out several attacks on villages around
Bambari and in central and northern CAR. At
least 30 people were killed.
VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY
AFRICAN UNION PEACEKEEPERS
Chadian national army (ANT) members and
those of the Chadian contingent of MISCA
were allegedly involved in serious human
rights violations. In some instances MISCA
forces failed to protect civilians, while in
others members of its contingents allegedly
committed serious human rights violations
with impunity.
On 4 February, members of the ANT
allegedly shot dead three people in the town
of Boali, while they were repatriating Chadians
and Muslims to Chad. On 18 February,
Chadian troops were responsible for killing at
least eight people including children, when
they indiscriminately opened fire on a crowd
in Damara and at the PK12 neighbourhood
of Bangui. On 29 March, troops opened
fire on a market crowd in Bangui killing
and injuring several civilians. Following
criticism from the international community,
the Chadian authorities withdrew their 850
soldiers from MISCA in April. On 24 March
101MISCA’s Congolese (Brazzaville) contingent
were allegedly implicated in the enforced
disappearance of at least 11 people, including
four women, from the home of a local militia
leader in Boali.
No MISCA peacekeepers had been
investigated for human rights violations by the
end of the year.
PRISON CONDITIONS
The conditions and security at Bangui’s
Ngaragba prison remained of concern. On
3 November, 584 prisoners were registered,
including 26 minors. The prison’s capacity
was 500 adults. In late November more than
650 inmates were held in cramped cells.
There was a lack of adequate sanitation
and protection against malaria. Prisoners
defecated in plastic bags which they threw
outside, jeopardizing their own health and
that of people living nearby.
Anti-Balaka militia attacked the prison
in January 2014 and killed at least four
suspected Séléka members detained there.
That led to the escape of all prisoners. CAR
officials told Amnesty International that the
anti-Balaka members who led the attack were
well known to them. However, by the end of
the year, no action had been taken to bring
the perpetrators to justice.
On 24 November, a riot erupted at
Ngaragba prison. Some prisoners, suspected
of being anti-Balaka members, armed with
at least three Kalashnikov rifles and hand
grenades, attacked the prison guards and the
UN contingent guarding the prison. According
to witnesses, at least one UN peacekeeper
and 13 inmates were wounded. The riot
followed the death of a detainee allegedly for
lack of medical treatment and harsh detention
conditions. The detainees also demanded that
their cases be heard in reasonable time, with
some complaining of having been in detention
for 10 months without trial.
intimidation by armed groups and the
transitional authorities. Several journalists
were reportedly killed because of their work.
No effective investigations were known to
have been carried out into these incidents.
On 29 April, two journalists were attacked in
Bangui. Désiré Luc Sayenga, a Démocrate
newspaper journalist, died after being knifed
and shot by a group of young men. René
Padou, who worked with the protestant
church Radio La Voix de la Grâce, died
after an armed group threw grenades and
shot him. Both journalists had previously
denounced crimes committed across
the CAR.
IMPUNITY
The transitional authorities and the UN
failed to effectively investigate crimes under
international law, including war crimes
and crimes against humanity committed
in CAR, therefore perpetuating the cycle
of violence and fear. In July, Amnesty
International published a dossier naming
20 individuals, including anti-Balaka and
Séléka commanders, against whom it had
credible evidence to suspect that they could
be responsible for war crimes, crimes against
humanity and other serious human rights
abuses committed since December 2013.
In December the organization revealed that
some of these men were allegedly implicated
in interference with the administration of
justice and further crimes under international
law between September and October 2014.

were often victims of harassment and
102
Serious human rights violations continued
to take place with almost total impunity.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15The rights to freedom of expression and to
peaceful assembly were frequently violated.
Human rights defenders, journalists and
trade unionists were victims of harassment,
intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention.
People, including protesters, were killed
by members of the security services during
demonstrations.
BACKGROUND
Issues related to economic, social and cultural
rights were of great concern throughout the
year. Across the country, people, including
civil servants, organized demonstrations
demanding pay increases and denouncing
the high cost of living. Chad was hosting more
and more refugees from the Central African
Republic (CAR), Sudan and recently Nigeria,
putting pressure on the already scarce
resources and creating tensions within the
communities, especially in south, east and
northwestern parts of the country. Individuals
responsible for committing human rights
violations, including members of the police,
the gendarmerie and the National Intelligence
Agency (ANS), continued to do so with almost
total impunity.
IMPUNITY
Members of the army and the Chadian
component of the then African Union mission
to the Central African Republic (MISCA),
who were involved in killing civilians and
other serious human rights violations in the
CAR, had impunity after they withdrew from
MISCA on 3 April. On 29 March, Chadian
troops opened fire at a crowd in a market
in the PK12 district of Bangui, the capital
of the CAR, killing and wounding dozens
of people. Chadian troops were involved in
other incidents including killings of civilians
in the towns of Boali, Damara and in PK12 in
February. On 19 July, President Idriss Déby
appointed the Chadian rebel leader Abdel
Kader "Baba Ladde" as préfet of Grande
Sido prefecture at the border with the CAR.
He was appointed despite the fact that he
and members of his armed group Popular
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Front for Recovery (Front Populaire pour
le Redressement, FPR) had been accused
of serious human rights abuses including
the recruitment and use of child soldiers in
northern CAR. They had also been accused
of setting fire to villages in northern CAR
between January and July. He later fled Chad
and on 10 December, he was arrested by
UN peacekeepers near the town of Kabo in
northern CAR, at the border with Chad. He
was arrested on an arrest warrant issued
by judicial authorities in Bangui in May and
remained detained in the prison in Bangui at
the end of the year.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
According to the UN Panel of Experts on
CAR, three civil servants from the CAR,
namely the sous-préfet of Markounda, the
secretary-general of the sous-préfecture and
the director of a public school, were arrested
by Chadian security forces in the CAR on 17
May and taken to N’Djamena, the capital of
Chad. The three were not released despite
several requests from the CAR authorities.
On 23 June, two members of the UN Panel
of Experts on CAR were arrested by Chadian
defence and security forces at a border post
in the CAR while conducting investigations.
The UN Panel reported that its experts
had identified themselves, explained their
mandate, privileges and immunities but that
they were forcibly driven from the border post
to the town of Goré in Chad where they were
detained for four hours, before being escorted
back to the border and released.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Conditions remained harsh in most of the
country’s prisons. According to witnesses,
conditions were worse in detention facilities
where visits were not allowed. These were
run by the police, the gendarmerie and
the national security services. N’Djamena
remained without a prison after the demolition
of the city’s prison in December 2011.
Detainees were held in a former gendarmerie
103barrack compound in Amsinéné on the
outskirts of the city.
Harsh conditions in prisons frequently
led to prison escapes and revolts. On 4
November, a revolt erupted in Amsinéné
prison after the prison authorities had
not allowed some prisoners to stay in
the prison courtyard and forced them to
stay in cells instead. In solidarity with the
punished inmates, other prisoners gathered
in the main courtyard. The gendarmes
guarding the prison started shooting at the
prisoners. According to various sources, at
least one prisoner was killed and several
others wounded.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Human rights defenders, journalists and trade
unionists regularly faced violations of their
right to freedom of expression. They were
frequently intimidated, harassed or arbitrarily
arrested by security service officers and
administrative authorities.
On 8 October, community Radio FM
Liberté was suspended for seven days
following a decision by the High Council for
Communication. The station had broadcast a
statement signed by 12 human rights NGOs
criticizing the absence of fuel on the market.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Trade unions and political and human
rights groups were frequently denied the
right to peaceful activities or protests. Most
demonstrations were violently disrupted by
security forces.
On 11 November, protesters, including
teachers, demonstrating against the high
cost of living in N’Djamena and the towns of
Moundou and Sarh, were attacked by security
forces. According to various sources, at
least one person was killed and several were
wounded after being shot.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
The government proposed a draft bill
amending the penal code to criminalize
104
same-sex conduct between consenting adults
with jail sentences of between 15 and 20
years, and a fine of 50,000 to 500,000 CFA
francs (US$100 to 1,000). The bill was not
passed into law at the end of the year.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
At the end of the year, the Extraordinary
African Chambers (the Chambers) in Dakar,
Senegal, was finalizing its investigation
into alleged crimes by the former Chadian
President Hissène Habré. The Chambers
indicted him in July 2013 and, if the
investigating judges decided that there
was sufficient evidence, his trial would be
scheduled to start in May 2015. Habré’s
reign from 1982-1990 was marked by serious
human rights violations, including torture
and other ill-treatment, arbitrary arrests and
illegal detentions.
On 14 November, the trial of 26 former
state security agents connected to the Habré
era commenced in Chad. International and
local human rights organizations expressed
concern that the trial could undermine the
upcoming trial of Hissène Habré in Dakar,
Senegal. In October, the Chambers requested
Chad to send these suspects to Dakar but
Chad declined to transfer them and refused
another request by the Chambers to travel
to Chad to interview them. There were also
concerns from the victims and human rights
organizations that the trial may not meet
international fair trial standards.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Despite efforts by the international community
and the authorities to assist the tens of
thousands of people who recently fled into
the country from the CAR and Nigeria, their
living conditions remained dire. Shelter,
food and medical facilities were needed by
more than 150,000 refugees and Chadian
returnees. Most of them were living in camps
in southern Chad near the border with CAR.
Throughout the year, violence caused by the
armed group Boko Haram in Nigeria also
forced thousands to flee to Chad, mostly to
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the area near Lake Chad; 368,000 refugees
from Darfur were living in refugee camps in
eastern Chad. Some 97,000 refugees from
CAR who fled their country stayed in camps
in southern Chad.
On 8 August, the authorities of Logone
Oriental province in southern Chad forcibly
and without prior notice relocated people from
the Doba transit site to another site in the
village of Kobitey.
CHILE
Republic of Chile
Head of state and government: Michelle Bachelet
Jeria (replaced Sebastián Piñera Echenique in
March)
Cases of police violence continued to
be dealt with by military courts. Legal
proceedings against those responsible for
past human rights violations continued.
BACKGROUND
In March, Michelle Bachelet Jeria took office
promising to decriminalize abortion in certain
circumstances. She also pledged to bring
the anti-terrorism law and the military justice
system into line with international standards.
Chile accepted most of the
recommendations made under the UN
Universal Periodic Review. These included a
call for the 1978 Amnesty Law to be repealed
and for reform to legislation regulating sexual
and reproductive rights. In June, the UN
Human Rights Committee made similar
recommendations. 1
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
In August, the police made public the security
protocols used during demonstrations. This
followed repeated complaints about the lack
of transparency of the methods used by the
police to respond to protests. There had been
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
repeated allegations of excessive use of force
by police during protests since 2011.
MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM
Cases of human rights violations involving
members of the security forces continued to
be dealt with by military courts. 2 Decisions
by the Supreme Court and the Constitutional
Court, upholding the right to due process
and international human rights obligations,
transferred some cases to ordinary courts. 3
In May, a former police officer was
sentenced to three years and 61 days'
imprisonment for fatally shooting 16-year-
old Manuel Gutierrez Reinoso and injuring
Carlos Burgos Toledo during a protest in
2011. However, as the sentence imposed
was for less than five years, the officer was
conditionally released. The family’s appeal
against the sentence was pending before a
higher military court at the end of the year. 4
In 2013, a police officer was found
responsible by a military court for inflicting
serious injuries on journalist Víctor Salas
Araneda and sentenced to 300 days'
conditional release and suspended from work.
However, Víctor Salas Araneda, who lost the
sight in his right eye while he was reporting on
a protest in 2008, was not granted reparation.
Death in custody
In May, Iván Vásquez Vásquez died in
custody in Chile Chico, Aysén region. The
family’s lawyers argued that he was beaten to
death and that more than one police officer
was involved in the crime. A first autopsy
indicated that suicide was not the cause of
death, as initially indicated by the police. A
police officer was charged by a military court
with using unnecessary violence resulting in
death. However, the charges were dropped
in October after a second autopsy requested
by the defence stated that the cause of death
was suicide. Concerns remained around the
impartiality of this autopsy. Full results of the
autopsy were pending at the end of the year.
105IMPUNITY
Some progress was made in bringing
to justice those responsible for human
rights violations committed under General
Pinochet’s regime. According to the President
of the Supreme Court, by March there were
1,022 active cases, of which 72 related
to allegations of torture. Official data from
the Ministry of the Interior Human Rights
Programme indicated that, by October, 279
people had been convicted in connection
with these crimes; these convictions were
not subject to appeal. At the end of 2014,
75 people were serving prison sentences in
connection with these crimes.
In May, 75 former agents of the secret
police (Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional,
DINA) were convicted in connection with the
enforced disappearance of Jorge Grez Aburto
in 1974. 5 In October the Supreme Court
convicted former DINA members, including
its former head Manuel Contreras Sepúlveda,
of the enforced disappearance of Carlos
Guerrero Gutiérrez and Claudio Guerrero
Hernández, in 1974 and 1975 respectively.
Investigations into the torture of Leopoldo
García Lucero were continuing at the end of
the year. In August 2013, in its first ruling
on a case of a Chilean torture survivor, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights
condemned the excessive delays in initiating
the investigations into this crime. 6
In June, the authorities announced
legal reforms that would, if implemented,
make torture a specific offence in the
Criminal Code.
In September, the government announced
its intention to speed up the discussion of a
2006 bill to overturn the 1978 Amnesty Law.
The debate around the amnesty law was
ongoing before the Congress at the end of the
year. 7
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
There were renewed allegations of excessive
use of force and arbitrary detention
during police operations against Mapuche
Indigenous communities. There were
106
particular concerns about abuses against
minors in the context of the conflict.
In May, the Supreme Court confirmed the
18-year prison sentence of Celestino Córdova,
a Mapuche machi (traditional healer), in
connection with the deaths in January 2013
of Werner Luchsinger and Vivianne Mackay.
The couple died following an arson attack
on their house in the Vilcún community,
Araucanía region. The Oral Criminal Court
of Temuco, which ruled in the first instance,
dismissed the prosecution’s allegation that
this was a terrorist attack. The defence
alleged that Celestino Córdova’s trial was
politically motivated and had fallen short of
international fair trial standards, and was
another example of how the authorities dealt
with the issue by criminalizing Mapuche
land claims rather than seeking to resolve
underlying issues.
In October, José Mauricio Quintriqueo
Huaiquimil died after being run over by a
tractor while he and other Mapuche were
entering a farm in the Araucanía region.
According to reports, they had gone to the
farm in connection with a proposal they were
preparing for the authorities about what
part of the land could be given to them. The
community had been occupying part of the
farm with the owner’s agreement. A man
suspected of responsibility for the death was
detained and the investigation was continuing
at the end of the year.
In April, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of human rights
and fundamental freedoms while countering
terrorism published a report on his 2013
visit to Chile highlighting discrepancies
between the national anti-terrorism law and
the principle of legality and due process in
the context of Mapuche proceedings. A bill
to reform the anti-terrorism law was under
discussion in Congress at the end of the year.
In May, the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights condemned Chile for human
rights violations in its application of the
anti-terrorism law against eight Mapuche
sentenced in 2003. The Inter-American Court
Amnesty International Report 2014/15also ordered the state to adopt all necessary
measures to ensure that court decisions in
these cases were not enforced. The Inter-
American Court argued that the stereotyping
of the accused in these cases violated the
principles of equality, and non-discrimination
and equal protection before the law.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Abortion remained a criminal offence in
all circumstances. A bill to decriminalize
abortion in cases of rape, incest, threats to
the life of the woman and foetal malformation
was announced by the government but not
submitted to the Congress.

DISCRIMINATION
In October, legislation on civil partnerships,
including for same-sex couples, was passed
by the Senate. At the end of the year, it was
under discussion by the Deputies Chamber .
A bill on the right to gender identity that
would allow people to change their name and
gender on official documents was before the
Senate at the end of the year.

The authorities continued to severely
restrict the right to freedom of expression.
Activists and human rights defenders
risked harassment and arbitrary detention.
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
widespread and access to justice was
elusive for many. Ethnic minorities
including Tibetans, Uighurs and Mongolians
faced discrimination and increased security
crackdown. Record numbers of workers
went on strike demanding better pay and
conditions. In November 2013, the Central
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
in its Third Plenum issued a blueprint for
deepening economic and social reforms,
paving the way for modifications to family
planning policies and China’s household
registration system. The abolition of the
Re-education Through Labour system
was also announced in 2013. The Fourth
Plenum in October 2014 focused on the
rule of law.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
Throughout 2014, President Xi Jinping
continued to pursue a high-profile anti-
corruption campaign, targeting both low- and
high-ranking officials. In July, state media
announced that Zhou Yongkang, a former
Minister of Public Security and Communist
Party Politburo Standing Committee member,
107had been under investigation for alleged
corruption since late 2013. He was the most
senior official targeted in the campaign, in
which, thus far according to official sources,
more than 100,000 officials had been
investigated and punished.
The UN Committees on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights and on the Elimination
of Discrimination against Women, reviewed
China’s implementation of the ICESCR and
CEDAW 1 in May and October respectively.
In December 2013 the UN Human Rights
Council adopted the outcome document of
China’s second Universal Periodic Review. In a rare case, an appeal court in Harbin,
Heilongjiang Province, in August upheld
the convictions of four people charged with
torture. They and three others had been
found guilty by the court of first instance of
torturing several criminal suspects in March
2013, and were sentenced to between one
and two and a half years in prison. Only three
of the seven were police officers; the other
four were “special informants” – ordinary
citizens allegedly “helping” the police to
investigate crimes. One of their victims died
in custody after being tortured with electric
shocks and beaten with a shoe.
ARBITRARY DETENTION TRADE IN TORTURE INSTRUMENTS
AND MISUSE OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT
The National People’s Congress officially
abolished China’s notorious Re-education
Through Labour system in December 2013.
Following its abolition, the authorities made
extensive use of other forms of arbitrary
detention, including Legal Education Centres,
various forms of administrative detention,
“black jails”, and illegal house arrest. In
addition, police frequently used vague
charges of “picking quarrels and provoking
trouble” and “disturbing order in a public
place” to arbitrarily detain activists for up to
37 days. Members of the Chinese Communist
Party suspected of corruption were held
under the secretive system of shuanggui (or
“double-designation”) without access to legal
assistance or their families.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
widespread. In March, four lawyers who
were investigating a Legal Education Centre
in Jiansanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, were
arbitrarily detained and tortured. One of them,
Tang Jitian, said that he was strapped to an
iron chair, slapped in the face, kicked, and
hit so hard over the head with a plastic bottle
filled with water that he passed out. He said
he was later hooded and handcuffed behind
his back and suspended by his wrists, while
police continued to beat him. 2
108
China consolidated its position as a major
manufacturer and exporter of a growing
range of law enforcement equipment,
including items with no legitimate policing
function such as electric shock stun
batons and weighted leg cuffs. In addition,
equipment that could be used legitimately
in law enforcement but was easy to abuse,
such as tear gas or riot control vehicles, has
been exported from China without adequate
controls even when there was a substantial
risk of serious human rights violations by the
receiving law enforcement agencies. 3
DEATH PENALTY
In May, the Supreme People’s Court in
a landmark ruling overturned the death
sentence of Li Yan, a victim of domestic
violence, and ordered a retrial. This was
still pending at the end of the year. The
Ziyang City Intermediate People’s Court had
sentenced Li Yan to death in 2011 for the
murder of her husband, ignoring evidence of
sustained abuse.
In a rare case of acquittal, the High Court
in Fujian Province in August overturned the
death sentence of food stall owner Nian
Bin for allegedly poisoning neighbours with
rat poison. Nian Bin had originally been
sentenced to death in 2008, despite his claim
Amnesty International Report 2014/15that he had confessed under torture. 4 The
High Court cited insufficient evidence but did
not address the allegations of torture.
Similarly, in the case of Hugjiltu, a man
from Inner Mongolia who was executed for
rape and murder in 1996, in December the
Inner Mongolia People’s Court declared his
innocence and rescinded its original verdict.
His family was awarded over 2 million yuan in
compensation.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders continued to
risk harassment, arbitrary detention,
imprisonment, and torture and other ill-
treatment for their legitimate human rights
work. Cao Shunli died from organ failure
in a hospital in March after being denied
adequate medical care in detention for an
existing condition. 5 She had been detained
at a Beijing airport in September 2013 when
on her way to a human rights training in
Switzerland.
The crackdown on rights activism
intensified during the year. Individuals
associated with a loose network of activists
called the New Citizens’ Movement were
sentenced to between two and six and a
half years’ imprisonment. The movement
campaigned for equal education rights for
children of migrant workers, abolition of
the household registration system, greater
government transparency and against
corruption. 6 More than 60 activists were
arbitrarily detained or put under illegal house
arrest in the run-up to the 25 th anniversary in
June of the violent crackdown in 1989 of pro-
democracy protests in and around Tiananmen
Square in Beijing. Several remained in
detention awaiting trial, including prominent
human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang. 7 In late
September and early October, approximately
100 activists across China were detained for
their support of pro-democracy protests in
Hong Kong. Thirty-one remained in detention
at the end of the year. 8
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The Chinese leadership increased its efforts to
systematically restrict freedom of information.
In late 2013, the Communist Party set up
a group to “coordinate internet security”.
However, a group member reportedly
described the task as engaging in a battle
“against ideological penetration” from “foreign
hostile forces”.
In June, the All China Lawyers Association
released draft regulations that would prohibit
lawyers from discussing ongoing cases or
writing open letters, or from criticizing the
legal system, government policies and the
Communist Party. Also in June, the State
Administration of Press, Publication, Radio,
Film and Television banned journalists from
reporting on issues or areas outside their
current field of reporting and from posting
critical articles that had not been approved by
their work unit.
The authorities continued to use criminal
law to suppress freedom of expression,
including by detaining and imprisoning
activists whose internet postings were viewed
more than 5,000 times or re-posted more
than 500 times.
Criminal charges were brought against
journalists. Gao Yu, a prominent journalist,
was taken away in April and later detained
on suspicion of “illegally disseminating
state secrets internationally”. Xiang Nanfu,
a contributor to Boxun, one of the largest
independent Chinese language news sources,
was detained in May. Both were shown on
national TV “confessing” to their alleged
crimes even before their trials began.
Ilham Tohti, a Uighur scholar and founder
of the website Uighur Online, was sentenced
to life imprisonment in September after being
convicted of “separatism”. Articles from the
website were the main evidence cited by the
authorities. Ilham Tohti was denied access
to legal counsel for five months after being
detained, and was tortured and denied food
in pre-trial detention. 9
109FREEDOM OF RELIGION MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
People practising religions banned by
the state, or without state permission,
risked harassment, arbitrary detention,
imprisonment, and torture and other ill-
treatment. In the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous
Region (XUAR), the authorities stepped up
already onerous restrictions on Islam with the
stated aim of fighting “violent terrorism and
religious extremism”. Numerous counties
posted notices on their websites stating that
students should not be permitted to observe
Ramadan, and many teachers gave food
and sweets to children to ensure that they
did not observe the fast. Prohibitions on
government employees and Communist Party
cadres adhering to a religion were reinforced
and several Uighur cadres were punished
for downloading religious materials from the
internet or “worshipping openly”. Outward
signs of adherence to Islam such as beards or
veils were often banned.
In Zhejiang province, a large-scale
campaign against churches was carried out
under the pretext of rectifying structures
with building code violations. The authorities
demolished churches and removed crosses
and crucifixes. In May, a building of the
Xiaying Holy Love Church in Ningbo was
reportedly demolished because it was “eye-
catching”. People practising banned religions,
such as those worshipping Christianity
in “house churches” or Falun Gong
practitioners, continued to face persecution. Changes to the household registration system
known as hukou made it easier for rural
residents to move to small or mid-size cities.
Access to benefits and services, including
education, health care and pensions,
continued to be linked to hukou status,
which remained a basis for discrimination.
The hukou system forced many internal
migrants to leave their children behind in the
countryside.
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
The changes to China’s family planning
policies enabled married couples to apply to
have two children if either parent is an only
child. The Standing Committee of China’s
National People’s Congress formalized the
changes in December 2013, and provinces
began to implement them in 2014. Many
restrictions on reproductive rights remained
in place.
110
XINJIANG UIGHUR AUTONOMOUS
REGION (XUAR)
Authorities ascribed numerous violent
incidents which occurred in the XUAR or
other regions to Uighur individuals, and used
these to justify a heavy-handed response.
In May, a “strike hard” campaign was
launched to target “violent terrorism and
religious extremism”, raising concerns that
accused individuals would not receive fair
trials. Top officials prioritized speed in making
arrests and convening trials, while calling for
greater “co-operation” between prosecuting
authorities and courts. By 26 May, XUAR
officials had announced the detention of over
200 suspected members of “terrorist and
extremist groups” and the breaking up of
23 “terror rings”. On 29 May, at one of the
several “sentencing rallies” since the launch
of the campaign, 55 people, all believed to be
Uighurs, were sentenced for crimes including
terrorism in front of nearly 7,000 spectators in
a stadium. 10
On 28 July, state media reported that 37
civilians were killed when a “knife-wielding
mob” stormed government offices in Yarkand
County (in Chinese: Shache) and that security
forces had shot dead 59 attackers. Uighur
groups disputed this account, putting the
death toll much higher and saying rather that
police opened fire on hundreds of people who
were protesting against the severe restrictions
placed on Muslims during Ramadan.
Uighurs faced widespread discrimination
in employment, education, housing and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15curtailed religious freedom, as well as political
marginalization.
TIBET AUTONOMOUS REGION
AND TIBETAN POPULATED AREAS
IN OTHER PROVINCES
Ethnic Tibetans continued to face
discrimination and restrictions on their rights
to freedoms of religious belief, expression,
association and assembly. Several Tibetan
monastic leaders, writers, protesters and
activists were detained.
In August, Tibetan demonstrators were
reportedly shot by police and security forces
in Kardze (in Chinese: Ganzi), Sichuan
Province, where a crowd had gathered to
protest against the detention of a village
leader. At least four demonstrators died from
their wounds and one protester committed
suicide in detention.
Seven people set themselves on fire in
Tibetan populated areas in 2014 in protest
against repressive policies by the authorities;
at least two died as a result. The number
of known self-immolations since March
2011 rose to 131. The authorities targeted
some relatives and friends of those who
self-immolated for allegedly “inciting” or
“abetting” such acts.
In some counties, family members
of self-immolators, or those who have
attended the Dalai Lama’s teachings, were
sympathetic towards the “Dalai Clique” or
had “connections overseas”, were barred
from senior positions or from standing as
candidates in village elections.
HONG KONG SPECIAL
ADMINISTRATIVE REGION
Freedom of assembly
Large-scale protests took place in Hong Kong
in 2014. On 1 July, organizers estimated that
more than 500,000 people took part in a pro-
democracy march, followed by a sit-in in the
business district. More than 500 protesters
were arrested the following night. 11 Some
reported they were not allowed access to
lawyers and were not provided with food and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
water for several hours before being released
without charge. In late September, thousands
of students staged a week-long class boycott
that culminated in a sit-in in front of the
Civic Square, near the headquarters of the
Hong Kong government. Later that night
some of the protesters entered the fenced-off
portion of the Civic Square. Police responded
with pepper spray and contained 70 of the
protesters in the Square, 20 of whom were
arrested the following day. 12
This led to calls for the start of a civil
disobedience campaign – “Occupy
Central” – to occupy streets in central Hong
Kong. On 28 September, the police used
tear gas and pepper spray in an attempt to
disperse thousands of peaceful protesters
who had gathered in streets near the
administrative headquarters. On 3 October,
counter-demonstrators attacked protesters,
including sexually assaulting, harassing
and intimidating women and girls, while the
police failed to intervene for several hours. 13
Journalists covering the protests complained
that police prevented them from doing their
job. On 15 October, six police officers were
filmed beating up a protester in a dark corner
in the Admiralty protest zone. 14 During the
clearance of the Mongkok protest zone 15
and outside the government complex in
Admiralty, in late November police used
arbitrary force against protesters, journalists
and bystanders. The largely peaceful protests
ended in mid-December and, according to
Hong Kong Police Commissioner Andy Tsang,
955 people were arrested in relation to the
Occupy protests and more arrests would be
made later.
Freedom of expression
Fears for the right to freedom of the press
were raised when Kevin Lau Chun-to, the
former chief editor of Ming Pao newspaper,
was removed from his post in January. Under
Lau, Ming Pao had reported on alleged
human rights violations and wrongdoings
of high-ranking officials in Hong Kong
and China.
111In October, over 20 journalists from
Television Broadcasts Limited, a local
television station, issued an open letter
criticizing perceived self-censorship by the
broadcaster in its reporting of the police
beating of “Occupy Central” protester Ken
Tsang Kin-Chiu.
Migrant domestic workers
Thousands of the approximately 300,000
migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong,
nearly all women, were trafficked for
exploitation and forced labour, and heavily
indebted with illegal and excessive agency
fees. The “Two-Week Rule”, which stipulates
that after an employment contract ends
migrant domestic workers must find new
employment or leave Hong Kong within two
weeks, and the requirement that migrant
domestic workers must live with their
employers, increased their risk of suffering
human and labour rights abuses. Employers
often subjected them to physical or verbal
abuse; restricted their freedom of movement;
prohibited them from practising their faith;
paid them less than the statutory Minimum
Allowable Wage; denied them adequate
rest periods; and arbitrarily terminated their
contracts, often in collusion with employment
agencies. The Hong Kong authorities failed to
properly monitor employment agencies and
punish those who violated the law.
In December, the District Court began
a high-profile trial involving three female
Indonesian migrant domestic workers:
Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, Nurhasanah and
Tutik Lestari Ningsih. Their former employer,
Law Wan-tung, faced 21 charges including
causing grievous bodily harm with intent,
assault, criminal intimidation and failure to
pay wages. 16
democracy group, said he was suspended for
"imposing political beliefs" on his students;
after an inquiry, the university did not renew
his contract. Another academic, Eric Sautede,
a lecturer at the University of St. Joseph, lost
his post in July; the university rector told a
local Portuguese language newspaper it was
due to Eric Sautede’s political commentary.

COLOMBIA
Republic of Colombia
Head of state and government: Juan Manuel Santos
Calderón
The peace talks between the government
and the guerrilla group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia,
FARC) continued to make progress, despite
a three-week suspension of negotiations
towards the end of the year. The two sides
reached partial agreements on several key
issues. The peace process emerged as a
key theme in the May presidential election,
which was won by the incumbent Juan
Manuel Santos following a second round in
June. 1 The election campaign was marred
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
by a scandal involving the wiretapping
of government and FARC negotiators by
elements within the security forces and
intelligence services in an attempt to derail
the peace process. Despite the ongoing
peace talks, human rights violations and
violations of international humanitarian
law (IHL) continued to be committed
by both sides, as well as by paramilitary
groups operating alone or in collusion
with or with the acquiescence of sectors
of the security forces. Indigenous People,
Afro-descendant and peasant farmer
communities, women and girls, human
rights defenders, community activists and
trade unionists bore the brunt of the human
rights consequences of the 50-year-long
armed conflict. Such abuses included forced
displacements, unlawful killings, hostage
taking and abductions, death threats,
enforced disappearances, torture and
sexual violence. The government promoted
legislation that threatened to exacerbate
impunity and undermine the little progress
made in recent years to bring to justice
some of those suspected of crimes under
international law and other human rights
abuses and violations.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
The civilian population, especially Indigenous,
Afro-descendant and peasant farmer
communities, as well as human rights
defenders continued to be the most affected
by the armed conflict. According to the latest
figures available from the NGO CODHES
(Consultoría para los Derechos Humanos y
el Desplazamiento), almost 220,000 people
were forcibly displaced in 2013.
According to the National Indigenous
Organization of Colombia (Organización
Nacional Indígena de Colombia, ONIC), 10
Indigenous people were killed for conflict-
related reasons and at least 2,819 forcibly
displaced in the first nine months of 2014. 2 In
2013, 30 killings and 3,185 victims of forced
displacement were recorded.
113On 12 September, two Embera Dovida
Indigenous leaders were killed in Alto Baudó
Municipality, Chocó Department, reportedly
by the guerrilla group, National Liberation
Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ELN).
Afro-descendant communities in the south
western port city of Buenaventura were the
target of a growing wave of violence, including
killings and enforced disappearances,
carried out mostly by paramilitaries and
criminal gangs. Some of the victims were
dismembered. The violence was concentrated
in poor areas of the city earmarked for the
development of port infrastructure and other
economic projects. 3
The sheer scale of human rights abuses
was underscored by a report published by the
state’s National Centre of Historic Memory in
2013. It concluded that between 1985 and
2012, almost 220,000 people were killed,
80% of them civilians. At least 25,000 people
were the victims of enforced disappearances,
carried out mostly by paramilitaries and the
security forces. Some 27,000 people were
kidnapped between 1970 and 2010, mostly
by guerrilla groups, and more than 5 million
people were forcibly displaced between 1985
and 2012. By November, the government had
registered more than 7 million victims.
PEACE PROCESS
The peace negotiations, held in Havana,
Cuba, between the government and the FARC
continued to offer the best chance in over a
decade to put an end to hostilities. However,
on 17 November, the government suspended
talks in protest at the capture of an army
general by the FARC in Chocó Department.
He was released on 30 November and talks
resumed on 10 December. On 17 December,
the FARC declared a unilateral ceasefire that
began on 20 December.
At the end of the year, the two sides had
reached partial agreements on three of the
six agenda items. A framework agreement on
a fourth, on victims’ rights, was made public
in June.
114
The framework agreement marked
a significant step forward as both sides
acknowledged their responsibility for human
rights abuses, that victims’ rights lay at the
heart of the peace process and that these
rights were non-negotiable. The framework
agreement did not, however, make an
explicit commitment to guarantee justice
for all victims. There were fears this could
undermine the long-term viability of an
eventual peace agreement. 4
SOCIAL PROTEST
Senior state officials claimed that a national
strike by peasant farmers in April had been
infiltrated by guerrilla groups. This placed
demonstrators at risk of revenge attacks by
paramilitaries. In May, paramilitaries sent
a death threat to human rights defenders
accusing them of organizing the strike, which
they claimed was supported by guerrilla
groups. 5
Similar accusations by the authorities
were made during protests by Indigenous
communities in October 2013, a national
peasant farmer strike in August 2013, and
peasant farmer demonstrations in Catatumbo
in June 2013. There were allegations that
the security forces used excessive and
disproportionate force during the protests.
The UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights stated that nine protesters, five
bystanders and one police officer were killed
with firearms during the protests in 2013.
SECURITY FORCES
Extrajudicial executions by the security forces
continued to be reported, albeit in fewer
numbers than during the administration
of President Álvaro Uribe (2002-2010).
However, the Office of the Attorney General
failed to make progress in bringing to justice
most of those responsible for these crimes,
especially senior officers. Many cases
continued to be referred to military courts.
These courts, which are neither independent
nor impartial, failed to deliver justice.
According to the report on the situation of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15human rights in Colombia published by
the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights in January, 48 cases of extrajudicial
executions attributed to the security forces
were transferred to the military justice system
and “numerous other cases were transferred
directly by civilian prosecutors” in the first
eight months of 2013.
PARAMILITARIES
The Justice and Peace Law (Law 975
of 2005), through which thousands of
paramilitaries who laid down their arms in
a government-sponsored process were to
benefit from a maximum of eight years in
prison in return for confessions about human
rights violations, failed to respect the right of
victims to truth, justice and reparation. The
process began in 2005, but by September
2014, only 63 paramilitaries had been
convicted of human rights violations under
Law 975. Most of the 30,000 paramilitaries
who reportedly laid down their arms failed to
submit themselves to the limited scrutiny of
Law 975.
These groups, which the government
referred to as criminal gangs (bandas
criminales, Bacrim), continued to operate
and to commit serious human rights
violations, either alone or in collusion with
or with the acquiescence of sectors of
the security forces. Such groups targeted
human rights defenders, community leaders
and trade unionists, as well as Indigenous,
Afro-descendant and peasant farmer
communities. 6
Around 160 paramilitaries who submitted
themselves to Law 975 were eligible for
release in 2014. Some were high-ranking
leaders who had been in prison on remand
but had served the maximum eight years
stipulated in Law 975. Many were expected
to return to their original areas of operation,
raising concerns about the impact on the
safety of victims and human rights defenders
in these areas.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
GUERRILLA GROUPS
Guerrilla groups committed serious
human rights abuses and violations of
international humanitarian law, especially
against communities in rural areas.
Despite the FARC's public commitment to
end kidnappings, cases continued to be
reported. The NGO País Libre reported 233
kidnappings in the first nine months of 2014,
compared to 299 in the whole of 2013. Most
kidnappings were attributed to common
criminals, with guerrilla groups responsible for
21% and paramilitaries for 3% of the total.
Landmines, mostly laid by the FARC,
continued to kill and maim civilians and
members of the security forces. Guerrilla
groups, as well as paramilitary groups,
continued to conscript children, mostly in
rural areas, forcing many families to flee their
homes to protect their children. The FARC
also carried out indiscriminate attacks that
placed civilians at risk.
IMPUNITY
Impunity remained a hallmark of the conflict,
with very few perpetrators of human rights
abuses held to account. The government’s
support of legislation that threatened to boost
impunity called into question its commitment
to the right of victims to truth and justice.
In October, the government presented two
bills to Congress. The first sought to expand
the crimes that could be considered acts of
service under the remit of the military justice
system. The second could ensure that human
rights violations committed by the security
forces would not be investigated as criminal
actions, but rather in a manner to determine
whether or not they constitute breaches
of international humanitarian law. This
could result in those responsible escaping
criminal prosecution by presenting the crime
as a proportionate action in the course of
armed conflict.
In September, 12 UN human rights experts
warned that Senate Bill No. 85, which was
under discussion in Congress at the time
of writing, would be a step backwards for
115human rights: “[ I]f adopted, Bill No.85
could seriously weaken the independence
and impartiality of the judiciary ... Its
adoption would also ... represent a major
setback in the Colombian state’s long-
standing fight against impunity for cases of
violations of international humanitarian law
and international human rights law.” The
bill listed a number of crimes that would be
dealt with exclusively by the military justice
system, including homicide and breaches
of international humanitarian law . Since
extrajudicial executions are not a separate
crime in the Criminal Code, they could be
defined as homicide and thus investigated by
military prosecutors.
In August 2013, the Constitutional Court
had upheld the constitutionality of the Legal
Framework for Peace, approved by Congress
in June 2012. This could enable alleged
human rights abusers to evade justice by
giving Congress the power to limit criminal
trials to those “most responsible” for human
rights abuses, and to suspend prison
sentences handed down to paramilitary,
guerrilla and security force combatants
convicted of such crimes. But the Court
ruled that the sentences of those “most
responsible” could not be suspended if they
were responsible for crimes against humanity,
genocide or war crimes. However, there was
no clear definition of, or criteria to determine,
“most responsible”.
LAND RESTITUTION
The Victims and Land Restitution Law, which
came into force in 2012, sought to provide
full reparation, including land restitution,
to some of the victims of the conflict. The
legislation was an important step forward in
efforts to acknowledge some victims’ right
to reparation, but it remained flawed and its
implementation progressed slowly. By August
2014, only some 30,000 hectares of land had
been adjudicated to peasant farmers and only
one 50,000-hectare territory to Indigenous
communities. Official figures suggested that
in the course of the conflict an estimated 8
116
million hectares of land had been subject to
abandonment or dispossession.
Land claimants and those representing
them, including human rights defenders
and state officials, were threatened or killed,
mostly by paramilitary groups. 7 By August
2014, the Office of the Attorney General
was investigating the killing of at least 35
individuals who had a suspected association
with land restitution. On 8 July, Robinson
Álvarez Quemba, a topographer working
with the government’s Land Restitution Unit,
was shot by an unidentified assailant while
working in the municipality of San Roque,
Antioquia Department. He died of his injuries
three days later.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders faced grave dangers.
The Office in Colombia of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 40
killings of human rights defenders between
January and September. This compared
to more than 70 human rights defenders
killed in 2013, according to the NGO Somos
Defensores. Indigenous and Afro-descendant
leaders, land activists and community leaders
were among the victims. According to the
NGO, National Trade Union School (Escuela
Nacional Sindical), 20 members of trade
unions were killed by 11 December; at least
27 were killed in 2013.
These attacks, as well as the theft of
sensitive information, ongoing death threats
and the misuse of the legal system to
bring bogus charges against human rights
defenders, undermined the work of human
rights organizations and fostered a climate of
fear. There was an increase in the number
of death threats towards the end of 2014.
In September and October, more than 100
human rights defenders, community leaders,
peace activists, land restitution leaders,
politicians and journalists, received a series
of mass email death threats from several
paramilitary groups. 8 Only a few of those
responsible for threats against and killings of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15human rights defenders were identified, let
alone brought to justice.
The state’s protection programmes,
coordinated by the National Protection Unit
(Unidad Nacional de Protección, UNP),
continued to provide security to thousands
of individuals at risk, including human rights
defenders. But these programmes suffered
from serious weaknesses, including severe
delays in implementing security measures.
In September, the UNP was rocked by
a corruption scandal in which senior UNP
officials, including the administrative director
and secretary general, were accused of taking
kickbacks from private contractors to whom
the UNP subcontracts most of its protection
work. The UNP also acknowledged in
September that because of a budget shortfall
it would have to withdraw the protection
schemes of some beneficiaries.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
All the parties to the conflict carried out rapes
and other forms of sexual violence, primarily
against women and girls. The authorities
continued to fail to implement Constitutional
Court Judicial Ruling 092 of 2008. This
ordered the authorities to put an end to
such crimes and to bring to justice those
responsible.
In June, President Santos signed into
law legislation on conflict-related sexual
violence (Law 1719). 9 The law defined such
violence as a war crime and a crime against
humanity. It addressed a number of specific
practices that continued to be carried out
in the conflict, including sexual slavery and
sexual exploitation, and enforced sterilization,
prostitution, abortion, pregnancy and nudity.
Under the law, no statute of limitations is
applicable in cases of genocide, crimes
against humanity and war crimes.
US ASSISTANCE
US assistance to Colombia continued to fall.
In 2014, the USA allocated some US$214.5
million in military and around US$164.9
million in non-military assistance to Colombia,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
compared to some US$228.6 million and
around US$195.9 million, respectively, in
2013. In September 2014, 25% of the total
military assistance for the year was released
after the US Secretary of State determined
that the Colombian government had made
progress in improving human rights.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
In her report on the human rights situation
in Colombia, published in January, the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
congratulated the Colombian government on
“its determined pursuit of a negotiated end
to the internal armed conflict”, but noted that
all parties to the conflict were still responsible
for human rights abuses and violations. The
report also stated that the unwillingness of
state institutions “to accept responsibility for
human rights violations undermines further
advances in human rights”.
In August, the Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights (IACHR) published its
report on the human rights situation in
Colombia. The report welcomed progress
in the peace talks but noted that the armed
conflict continued to have a serious impact on
human rights. It warned that the human rights
situation could not be resolved without also
addressing the problem of impunity.
In March, the IACHR requested that the
Colombian government adopt precautionary
measures for Bogotá Mayor Gustavo Petro
and that his removal from office, ordered
by the Office of the Procurator General in
January, be suspended until the IACHR could
rule on the case. The government initially
refused to comply with the request and only
reversed its decision after it was ordered to do
so by Colombia’s Constitutional Court in April.
The UN Human Rights Council adopted
the outcome of the September 2013
Universal Periodic Review of Colombia.
Amnesty International welcomed Colombia’s
support of recommendations to fight
impunity, but reiterated its concerns that
legislation to broaden the scope of military
jurisdiction and the Legal Framework for
117Peace would seriously undermine efforts to
combat impunity.

More than 179,000 foreign nationals from the
DRC, including refugees and asylum-seekers,
were forcibly returned during police operation
“Mbata ya Mokolo”. Some DRC nationals who
remained were in hiding, fearing deportation.
The operation was carried out by police
in cities nationwide, ostensibly to reduce
irregular immigration and criminality, and
targeted people from the DRC in particular.

CONGO
(REPUBLIC OF)
Republic of Congo
Head of state and government: Denis Sassou
Nguesso
Serious human rights violations including
cases of rape and other sexual violence,
arbitrary arrests and detention, excessive
118
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Freedom of expression including press
freedom was seriously limited including
in relation to proposed constitutional
amendments to allow President Nguesso a
third term in office. Journalists were subject
to harassment and intimidation by the
police and local authorities. Human rights
defenders feared for their security and were
consequently reluctant to denounce violations
involving high-profile officers.
On 26 September, Cameroonian
journalist Elie Smith was expelled following
a statement by the Ministry of the Interior
accusing him of “seditious and subversive
acts” and “intelligence with foreign
powers working against the interests of the
Republic of Congo”. Local human rights
organizations claimed that the decision was
politically motivated.
On 23 September, freelance journalist
Sadio Kanté was forced to leave the country,
accused of illegal residence among other
charges. She denied all the allegations.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Freedom of peaceful assembly, especially for
trade unions and perceived or actual political
opponents of the government, was severely
restricted during the year.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 4 November, police burst into the
Brazzaville residence of Clément Mierassa,
opposition leader and president of the
Congolese Democratic Social Party, and
disbanded a political meeting. According
to witnesses, the police beat some of the
participants. Around 30 arrests were made.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Several cases of arbitrary arrests and
detentions were reported during operation
Mbata ya Mokolo targeting DRC nationals,
including refugees and asylum-seekers legally
living in Congo. Opposition party members,
trade unionists and their family members
were also frequently subject to arbitrary arrest
and detention by the police.
On 4 January, police arrested Tamba
Kenge Sandrine and her four children. They
were released the same day without charge.
The arresting officer had come to arrest her
husband, Kouka Fidele, because of his trade
union activities, and arrested his wife and
children instead. Kouka Fidele spent several
months in hiding, fearing arrest.
Jean-Bernard Bossomba “Saio”, a refugee
from the DRC was arrested by the police on
22 May and detained in a national police cell
in Brazzaville until 22 July. No formal charges
were made. A former army officer in the
DRC, he said that he feared for his security if
returned there.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Reports were received in September alleging
that Congolese police officers were raping
women, including within refugee and asylum-
seeker communities. At the end of the year,
no action was known to have been taken by
the authorities to investigate the allegations.
A five-year-old girl was raped, allegedly
by police who, according to relatives,
took her and other family members from
their home in Brazzaville during the night.
Officers separated the girl from the group
before forcing them all to board a ferry to
Kinshasa, DRC. The child was taken to
hospital on arrival in Kinshasa, where it
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
was confirmed that she had been raped.
In September, Amnesty International
researchers referred the girl to a specialized
medical centre for additional treatment and
psychological support.
IMPUNITY
Police officers suspected of committing
serious human rights violations continued to
enjoy impunity. Congolese soldiers accused
of serious human rights violations, including
enforced disappearances, while serving in
regional peacekeeping forces in the Central
African Republic were not investigated.
In May the authorities announced that
18 police officers involved in human rights
violations during the Mbata ya Mokolo
operation had been suspended from their
duties. It was not clear if the suspension
remained in force at the end of year or if the
authorities had conducted any investigations
to establish whether police officers had been
responsible for violations.
In June the African Union announced that
it would open investigations into allegations
of Congolese members of the African-led
International Support Mission to the Central
African Republic (MISCA) being implicated
in the enforced disappearance on 24 March
of at least 11 people in the Central African
Republic. However, by the end of the year, no
such investigations were known to have been
initiated by the authorities.
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Republic of Côte d'Ivoire
Head of state: Alassane Ouattara
Head of government: Daniel Kablan Duncan
Côte d’Ivoire was examined by the UN
Universal Periodic Review mechanism
which raised concerns about the adequacy
of the government’s action on several
119issues including on women’s rights and
the lack of (or selective) accountability for
crimes committed during the post-electoral
violence in 2010-2011. Hundreds of
detainees awaited trial in connection with
post-electoral violence. Côte d’Ivoire refused
entry to more than 400 Ivorian refugees who
had fled to Liberia during the post-electoral
crisis. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and intersex (LGBTI) people continued to
face discrimination.
BACKGROUND
In December 2013, the government renewed
the mandate of the Special Investigation
Commission tasked with investigating crimes
committed during the 2010-2011 post-
electoral violence as well as the mandate
of the Commission for Dialogue, Truth and
Reconciliation (CDVR). The CDVR published
its findings in December 2014 and expressed
concern about selective justice.
In April 2014, Côte d’Ivoire was examined
by the UN Universal Periodic Review
mechanism, which raised concerns about
the adequacy of the government’s action on
several issues including: action to ensure
accountability for crimes committed during
the post-electoral violence in 2010-2011;
measures taken to implement the national
reconciliation process; efforts to ensure an
open and free election campaign before
the 2015 presidential elections; steps to
ensure a safe and enabling environment for
civil society; and women’s rights, including
measures to prevent sexual violence.
In July 2014, Côte d’Ivoire refused entry
to over 400 Ivorian refugees who had fled
to Liberia during the post-electoral violence.
Côte d’Ivoire claimed it was to prevent the
spread of the Ebola Virus Disease, which
was present in Liberia, but UNHCR, the
UN refugee agency, had ensured that every
refugee had had a medical screening. Despite
the screenings more than 35,000 Ivorian
refugees were waiting in Liberia for the Ivorian
authorities to reopen the border.
120
In November, the government agreed to
pay the outstanding wages and bonuses
claimed by soldiers who had protested
over two years of back pay and housing
benefits. Also in November, the opposition
party, Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), confirmed
Laurent Gbagbo’s candidacy for the 2015
Presidential elections, despite the fact
that he is awaiting trial at the International
Criminal Court (ICC). In December, the
Abidjan Tribunal declared Laurent Gbagbo’s
candidacy inadmissible.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
In January and May, more than 180 political
prisoners held in relation to post-electoral
violence of 2010-2011 were released, some
on a provisional basis in view of an upcoming
trial in 2015. More than 600 detainees were
awaiting trial in connection with the violence.
Some political prisoners held in the Maison
d’Arrêt et de Correction (MACA) Abidjan
prison staged a hunger strike to protest
against detention conditions and the slow
judicial process. Three political detainees
died in custody in the MACA in unclarified
circumstances.
In July, the Minister of Justice announced
that the investigation into the disappearance
of journalist Guy André Kieffer would be
reopened, as would the investigation into the
death of Yves Lambelin, head of the Société
immobilière et financière de la côte africaine
(SIFCA) who was killed during the post-
electoral crisis.
The trial of 83 people, including Simone
Gbagbo and Michel Gbagbo, wife and son
respectively of the former President Laurent
Gbagbo, and former senior officials of
the Gbagbo administration, began in late
December 2014. The accused face charges
including threatening state security and the
creation of armed groups.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Former President Gbagbo remained in
ICC custody. In June, the ICC confirmed
the charges against him and committed
Amnesty International Report 2014/15his case to trial. He will be tried for crimes
against humanity. The trial is currently set for
July 2015.
In March, Côte d’Ivoire surrendered Charles
Blé Goudé, accused of crimes against
humanity committed during post-electoral
violence, to the ICC. In December, the ICC
confirmed four charges of crimes against
humanity against him and committed him
to trial.
In December, the Pre-Trial Chamber of
the ICC rejected Côte d’Ivoire’s challenge to
the admissibility of the case against Simone
Gbagbo, who was charged by the ICC in
February 2012 with murder, sexual violence,
persecution and other inhuman acts,
allegedly committed during the post-electoral
crisis. Côte d’Ivoire has filed an appeal against
the decision.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex (LGBTI) people faced increasing
discrimination. In January, the office of
Alternative Côte d’Ivoire, an organization
working for the rights of LGBTI people living
with HIV, was ransacked by a large mob.
Computers were stolen, walls were daubed
with homophobic slogans and a staff member
was badly beaten. Police refused to respond
or investigate the incident. The Director of
Alternative Côte d’Ivoire’s house was also
later attacked. A security forces member was
reportedly among the attackers. Several staff
members subsequently went into hiding.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
Eight years after the dumping of toxic waste
in Abidjan no medical study had been
conducted to assess the long-term health
implications of exposure to the waste. The
company that made and sent the waste to
Abidjan – oil trader Trafigura – has never
disclosed the full information about the waste
content and its potential impact; nor has it
been properly held to account for its role
in the dumping. In October 2014, the UN
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Environment Programme (UNEP) confirmed
that it will carry out an environmental audit of
the dump sites in 2015.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
In December 2013, the UN Operation in
Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) released a report
on the Dozo, a group of traditional hunters
who fought on behalf of Alassane Ouattara
during the post-electoral crisis. The report
documented serious human rights violations
allegedly committed by members of the
Dozo between March 2009 and May 2013,
including unlawful killings, illegal arrest and
detentions, looting and extortions. At least
228 people were killed, 164 others injured
by bullets, machetes and knives, and 162
arbitrarily arrested and illegally detained.
In addition, 274 cases of looting, arson
and extortion were verified and confirmed,
including in the regions of Gbôklé, Haut-
Sassandra, Gôh, Cavally, Guemon, Tonkpi,
Marahoué, Nawa, Indenie-Djuablin, Poro and
Moronou. 1

CROATIA
Republic of Croatia
Head of state: Ivo JosipovicHead of government:
Zoran Milanovic
Discrimination against Croatian Serbs and
Roma continued. Same-sex partnerships
were legally recognized. The rate of
investigation and prosecution of war crimes
remained at a low level.
121DISCRIMINATION
Croatian Serbs
Croatian Serbs continued to face
discrimination in public sector employment
and the restitution of tenancy rights to social
housing vacated during the 1991-1995 war.
In July, the Constitutional Court ruled
unconstitutional a referendum petition
seeking to restrict the use of minority
language rights to local self-government units
where at least half of the population is from
an ethnic minority. Although the referendum
petition applied to the whole country, the
referendum petitioners, a Croat veteran
group, specifically sought to ban the use of
bilingual public signs in the Cyrillic (Serb)
alphabet in Vukovar. The current law on
minority rights sets the threshold at one third
of the population.
Roma
Many Roma continued to live in segregated
settlements without security of tenure and
with limited access to basic services such
as water, electricity, sanitation and transport
facilities. Four years after the 2010 judgment
of the European Court of Human Rights in
the case of Oršuš and Others v. Croatia, many
Roma children were still attending segregated
classes. Discrimination in the labour market
contributed to significantly higher rates of
unemployment among Roma compared with
other ethnic groups. Those living in rural
areas and young women were particularly
disadvantaged.
Rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex people
A Law on Life Partnership was adopted in
July that granted equal rights to same-sex
partnerships in all matters except adoption.
The law introduced the institution of “partner-
guardianship” to allow parents in same-sex
partnerships to extend the full range of
parental rights and obligations in relation to
their children to their partners. The first same-
sex partnership was registered in September.
Three safe and successful Pride marches
were held in Split, Zagreb and Osijek. In
March, Croatia granted asylum to a gay man
122
from Uganda who had sought protection
following the criminalization of homosexuality
in the country.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
In November, an indictment was issued
against a former member of the Croatian
armed forces for crimes committed during
Operation Storm in 1995. In March, Croat
Army Officer Božo Bačelić became the first
person to be convicted in national courts
for war crimes committed during the same
Operation Storm. Two further trials relating
to war crimes committed during Operation
Storm were ongoing by the end of the
year. In total, eight members of Croatian
military formations and 15 members of Serb
formations stood trial for war crimes during
the course of the year.
The European Court of Human Rights
initiated communication with the government
on 17 cases submitted by civilian victims of
war alleging violations of the right to life due
to the failure of the state to carry out effective
investigations into the killing or disappearance
of their relatives.
Croatia continued to stall on the adoption
of a comprehensive legislative framework that
would regulate the status of, and access to
reparation for, all civilian victims of war. In a
positive development in March, the Ministry
of Veterans’ Affairs presented a draft Act on
the Rights of Victims of Sexual Violence in the
Homeland War, which would grant victims
access to psychosocial and medical support,
free legal aid, and monetary compensation.
However, the draft law failed to specify the
level of financial compensation that would be
made available.
In August, Croatia signed a regional
declaration on missing persons, and
committed to pursuing measures to establish
the fate and whereabouts of the 2,200 still
missing in Croatia. Croatia had yet to ratify the
International Convention for the Protection of
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
The rights of relatives of missing persons
Amnesty International Report 2014/15continued to be undermined by the absence
of a law on missing persons.
CUBA
Republic of Cuba
Head of state and government: Raúl Castro Ruz
Freedoms of expression, association and
assembly continued to be repressed. The
number of short-term arrests increased
sharply and politically motivated criminal
prosecutions continued.
BACKGROUND
Amendments to the Migration Law which
became effective in January 2013 facilitated
travel abroad for all Cubans. Although
government critics were allowed to travel
abroad without hindrance, there were reports
of documents and other materials being
confiscated on their return to Cuba.
By the end of the year Cuba had still failed
to ratify the International Covenants on Civil
and Political Rights and on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights, both of which it had
signed in February 2008. The government
did not respond to requests to visit Cuba
from the UN Special Rapporteur on the
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly
and of association, sent in October 2013,
or from the Special Rapporteur on torture
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment, sent in March
2014. The authorities have not granted
Amnesty International access to the country
since 1990.
An exchange of prisoners between the
USA and Cuba in December, and the
announcement of the further release of
over 50 political prisoners, raised hopes
for significant human rights change amid
efforts to normalize relations between the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
two countries, which decided to renew their
diplomatic relations.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION, ASSEMBLY
AND MOVEMENT
Criticism of the government continued
to be repressed and was routinely
punished by various means, including
arbitrary and short-term detentions, “acts
of repudiation” (demonstrations led by
government supporters with the participation
of state security officials), intimidation,
harassment and politically motivated
criminal prosecutions. The judicial system
remained firmly under political control,
gravely undermining the right to trial by an
independent and impartial tribunal.
Government critics, independent
journalists and human rights activists were
frequently detained for exercising their
rights to freedom of expression, association,
assembly and movement. Activists were
detained as a preventive measure to stop
them from attending public demonstrations or
private meetings.
There were increasing reports of
government critics being threatened and
also physically assaulted by state actors or
individuals in their pay.
In June 2014, Roberto de Jesús Guerra
Pérez, director of the independent news
agency Hablemos Press, received threatening
telephone calls and was assaulted on
the streets of the capital, Havana, by an
unidentified individual, in what he believed
was an attempt by the authorities to dissuade
him from continuing his journalist activities. 1
The government continued to exert control
over all media, while access to information
on the internet remained challenging due
to technical limitations and restrictions
on content. Independent journalists were
systematically subjected to harassment,
intimidation and detention for reporting
information that was not sanctioned by the
state apparatus.
123In May, blogger Yoani Sánchez and her
husband launched an online news website
called 14 y medio. Shortly after it went
live, the website was hacked and anyone
accessing it from Cuba was redirected to a
webpage which carried propaganda against
Yoani Sánchez.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
At the end of the year, five prisoners of
conscience detained solely for peacefully
exercising their right to freedom of expression,
remained imprisoned. Three of them,
brothers Alexeis, Vianco and Django Vargas
Martín, were sentenced in November on
charges of “public disorder of a continuous
nature” after having spent more than a year
and a half in pre-trial detention. Alexeis was
sentenced to four years’ imprisonment, and
Vianco and Django to two and a half years. 2
Articles 72-90 of the Criminal Code which
criminalize “dangerousness” and punish
those deemed to be likely to commit a crime
in the future, were increasingly used as a
means to incarcerate government critics.
Prisoners of conscience Emilio Planas
Robert and Iván Fernández Depestre were
sentenced to three and a half and three years'
imprisonment in October 2012 and August
2013 respectively for “dangerousness”.
Emilio Planas Robert was accused of putting
up posters in Guantánamo City with “anti-
government” slogans.
Despite the relaxation of travel restrictions,
12 former prisoners of conscience arrested
as part of the mass crackdown in 2003 and
released in 2011 were not allowed to travel
abroad as they were deemed to be serving
their sentence outside prison.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Short-term arbitrary detentions as a tactic to
silence dissent increased sharply. The Cuban
Commission on Human Rights and National
Reconciliation reported 8,899 politically
motivated short-term detentions during 2014,
an increase of more than 27% compared
with 2013.
124
Members of the independent civil society
organization Ladies in White faced constant
harassment and every Sunday dozens were
detained for several hours to prevent them
from travelling to attend mass and carry out
peaceful marches. The organization reported
that 1,810 of its members had been arrested
during 2013.
Dozens of government critics were
arbitrarily detained or pressurized not to travel
to Havana during the second summit of the
Community of Latin American and Caribbean
States on 28 and 29 January. As a result
of the arrests and the wave of intimidation,
various meetings that were due to be held in
parallel to the summit had to be cancelled. 3
On 9 December, Ladies in White member
Sonia Garro Alfonso, her husband Ramón
Alejandro Muñoz González, and dissident
Eugenio Hernández Hernández, were
released and put under house arrest after
having spent more than two and a half years
in prison without trial. They were detained in
March 2012 during the visit of Pope Benedict
XVI, accused of assault, public disorder and
attempted murder. 4
US EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA
In September, the USA renewed the Trading
with the Enemy Act, which imposes financial
and economic sanctions on Cuba and
prohibits US citizens from travelling to and
engaging in economic activities with the
island. In October 2014, the UN General
Assembly adopted, for the 23rd consecutive
year, a resolution calling on the USA to lift
the unilateral embargo. US President Obama
announced in December that he will engage
in discussions with the US Congress in order
to lift the embargo on Cuba.

CYPRUS
Republic of Cyprus
Head of state and government: Nicos Anastasiades
Immigration authorities continued to
routinely detain hundreds of migrants
and certain categories of asylum-seekers
in prison-like conditions for extended
periods while awaiting deportation. Those
detained included Syrian refugees. Some
women detainees were separated from their
young children.
BACKGROUND
In February, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot leaders resumed negotiations
regarding the reunification of the island after
an 18-month break, but no progress had
been made by the end of the year.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Irregular migrants, rejected asylum-seekers
and certain categories of asylum-seekers
were routinely detained for prolonged periods
at the country’s main immigration detention
facility in the village of Menoyia, while
awaiting deportation. Syrian refugees were
also detained despite Cyprus’ formal policy
not to deport Syrian nationals.
People held at Menoyia were detained in
cramped, prison-like conditions. Detainees
complained about the limited time allowed to
exercise outside, the quality of the food and
the fact that their cells were locked between
10.30pm and 7.30am. A small number of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
migrant women were held in police stations
pending deportation. In at least two cases,
detained women were forcibly separated from
their young children. 1
In May, the UN Committee against Torture
raised concerns about the routine and
prolonged detention of irregular migrants and
asylum-seekers; the detention conditions
in Menoyia; and the reports that asylum-
seekers were deported to their countries of
origin despite facing a serious risk of torture
or religious persecution. The Committee also
criticized the fact that asylum-seekers were
not protected from refoulement during the
judicial review process and that there was
no effective judicial remedy to challenge
deportation decisions and halt deportations
pending the outcome of appeals.
TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS
In April, a law was adopted with the aim of
bringing national legislation on combating
trafficking in line with EU and other
international standards. However, the law
did not provide for appeals against decisions
by the Office of the Police for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings not to recognize
an individual as a victim of trafficking.
Concerns were also raised that police
employed a definition of a victim of trafficking
that fell short of international standards.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Between January and August, the Committee
of Missing Persons in Cyprus exhumed the
remains of 65 people, bringing the total
number of exhumations since 2006 to 948.
Between August 2006 and August 2014,
the remains of 564 missing individuals (430
Greek Cypriots and 134 Turkish Cypriots) had
been identified and restored to their families.
However, no perpetrators were identified
or prosecuted for the disappearances and
killings in either Cyprus or Turkey at the end
of the year. The graves date from the inter-
communal fighting which took place between
1963 and 1964, and during the Turkish
invasion in 1974.
125TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
A report published in December by the
European Committee for the Prevention of
Torture highlighted a number of allegations
of ill-treatment by police officers that were
received by the Committee's delegates during
their visit to Cyprus in September and October
2013. The allegations mainly concerned
ill-treatment of foreign nationals during their
transportation or interviews at police stations.
The European Committee for the Prevention
of Torture also received a number of
allegations concerning physical ill-treatment,
verbal abuse and inappropriate use of tear
gas by police guards against migrants held
at the Menoyia immigration detention facility.
Similar allegations were received by the UN
Committee against Torture.

Roma continued to face widespread
discrimination. The European Commission
initiated infringement proceedings against
the Czech Republic for the discrimination
against Roma pupils in education. The ill-
treatment of persons with mental disabilities
in state institutions was exposed. Muslims
faced growing public hostility.
BACKGROUND
citizens in the local elections held the same
month. According to NGOs monitoring the
elections, the practice of vote-buying was
used by a number of political parties in
several regions.
DISCRIMINATION
Roma
In June, the UN Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights criticized the
authorities for the large number of Roma
pupils in so-called “practical schools” (former
special schools), designed for pupils with
mild mental disabilities. The Committee
called on the government to abolish practices
that lead to the segregation of Roma pupils
and to phase out practical schools. It
recommended that mainstream schools
should provide inclusive education to children
from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and
Roma pupils.
In September, the European Commission
initiated infringement proceedings against the
authorities for breaching the prohibition of
discrimination in education set out in the EU
Race Equality Directive.
In August, over four years after the
government’s apology for the enforced
sterilization of Roma women, the Human
Rights Minister announced a draft law offering
financial compensation of between 3,500 and
5,000 euros to individual victims. According
to the NGO Czech Helsinki Committee, almost
1,000 women were forcibly sterilized between
1972 and 1991 and should be entitled to
financial remedy.
In November, the government
acknowledged that Roma continued to
face discrimination regarding access to
housing, education, health care and labour
market. The government-commissioned
report on the situation of the Roma minority
highlighted obstacles in accessing affordable
housing, including discrimination by private
landlords. The report also highlighted the
In October, the police announced an
investigation into allegations of the
manipulation and buying of votes of Roma
126
Amnesty International Report 2014/15over-representation of Roma children in
practical schools.
Hate crimes
In October, the Constitutional Court rejected
an appeal by two perpetrators against the
length of their sentences for an arson attack
against a Roma family in April 2009. The
attack had left a two-year-old Roma girl with
burns to 80% of her body.
Muslims
The media reported occasional acts of
vandalism on the Prague mosque, including
daubing of islamophobic messages. The
police were still investigating these incidents
at the end of the year.
In September, over 25,000 people signed
a petition calling on the authorities not to
grant “enhanced rights” to the registered
Association of Muslim Communities. The Law
on Churches allowed religious organizations,
which had been registered for 10 years, to
apply for enhanced rights, including the right
to teach religion in state schools and the
recognition of religious wedding ceremonies.
The petition called on the government not
to permit the opening of Muslim schools
and not to allow the teaching of Islam in
state schools or Muslim worship in prisons.
By the end of the year, the Association of
Muslim Communities had not applied for
“enhanced rights”.
In September, the Public Defender
of Rights (Ombudswoman) held that
a secondary school for nurses had
discriminated against two women, a refugee
from Somalia and an asylum-seeker from
Afghanistan, by prohibiting them from
wearing headscarves. The Public Defender
clarified that the law did not restrict the use
of religious symbols in schools and that the
seemingly neutral prohibition of any covering
of the head was indirectly discriminatory. A
complaint by the Somali student to the Czech
School Inspectorate was rejected.
June, the Mental Disability Advocacy Center
and the League of Human Rights called on
the government to immediately prohibit the
use of net beds and other inhumane restraint
techniques. In a report which assessed the
situation in eight psychiatric hospitals, the
NGOs provided evidence of the continuous
use of restraint techniques, such as net beds,
bed straps as well as the unregulated use
of excessive medication. In response to the
NGO report, the Public Defender of Rights
visited six hospitals in August and also found
evidence of the use of restraint techniques.
She criticized the lack of effective monitoring
of their use and called for legislative changes
introducing greater safeguards.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
In October, during a “week against anti-
racism and xenophilia”, the websites of the
NGOs Czech Helsinki Committee and Life
Together (Vzájemné soužití) were attacked
by far-right hackers. The personal email of
the co-ordinator of an Amnesty International
group in the city of Brno was also attacked
by the hackers, who published the members’
internal communication on their websites.
The Czech Helsinki Committee announced
that it would submit a criminal complaint
against the hackers.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Despite initial plans to start a small
resettlement programme for Syrian refugees,
the government decided in October to restrict
its support to the provision of humanitarian
assistance to Syrian refugees with acute
medical needs in Jordan.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Patients with mental disabilities continued to
be ill-treated in mental health institutions. In
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
127DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF
THE CONGO
Democratic Republic of the Congo
Head of state: Joseph Kabila
Head of government: Augustin Matata Ponyo Mapon
The security situation in eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) remained
dire and an upsurge in violence by armed
groups claimed the lives of thousands of
civilians and forced more than a million
people to leave their homes. Human rights
abuses, including killings and mass rapes,
were committed by both government
security forces and armed groups. Violence
against women and girls was prevalent
throughout the country. Plans to amend
the Constitution to allow President Kabila
to stay in office beyond 2016 prompted
protests. Human rights defenders,
journalists and members of the political
opposition were threatened, harassed and
arbitrarily arrested by armed groups and by
government security forces.
BACKGROUND
The Congolese army, with the support of the
UN peacekeeping force MONUSCO (UN
Organization Stabilization Mission in the
DRC), succeeded in defeating and disbanding
the armed group March 23 (M23) in 2013.
However, the conflict in eastern DRC did
not end and other armed groups expanded
their areas of operation and continued to
target civilians.
In January, the government launched
a military operation against the armed
group Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in
Beni territory, North Kivu province. While
“Operation Sokola 1” (“Operation Clean-up”
in Lingala) forced the ADF rebels from their
forest base, they regrouped and in October
128
launched a series of attacks, killing and
kidnapping civilians. 1
Other armed groups remained active in
North Kivu, Katanga, South Kivu and Ituri,
committing serious human rights abuses
against civilians.
Some fighters from the Forces
Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda
(FDLR) participated in a demobilization
programme run by MONUSCO and a few
were confined in government camps.
However, others carried on armed activities
in the east of the country. The MONUSCO
Demobilization, Disarmament, Repatriation,
Resettlement and Reintegration programme
included former FDLR child soldiers.
In July, President Kabila appointed
Jeannine Mabunda as his special envoy
on sexual violence and recruitment of
child soldiers.
In November, several hundred magistrates
went on strike over pay.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Armed groups committed atrocities against
civilians in eastern DRC, especially in
northern Katanga, Ituri, North Kivu and South
Kivu. Abuses included unlawful killings,
summary executions, forced recruitment
of children, rape and sexual violence,
large-scale looting, burning of homes
and destruction of property. Attacks were
characterized by extreme violence, sometimes
ethnically motivated. Some of the fighting was
for control over natural resources and trade.
The violence was facilitated by easy access to
weapons and ammunition.
Armed groups that committed abuses
against civilians included: the FDLR; the ADF;
Nyatura; the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA);
the Nduma Defence of Congo (NDC) known
as Mai Mai Sheka; and various other Mai Mai
groups including Mai Mai Lafontaine, Mai Mai
Simba and Mai Mai Bakata Katanga.
In June, attacks by Nyatura in Rutshuru
territory, North Kivu, left at least four civilians
dead and dozens of houses burned to
the ground.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On the night of 6 June, in Mutarule, Uvira
territory, South Kivu, at least 30 civilians were
killed in an attack by an unidentified armed
group. Most of the victims were from the
Bafulero ethnic group. The attack took place
just a few kilometres from a MONUSCO base.
Between early October and late December,
the ADF allegedly carried out a spate of
attacks on civilians in several towns and
villages in Beni territory, North Kivu, and Ituri
district, Province Orientale, killing at least 270
civilians and abducting others. The assailants
also looted civilians’ property.
Between 3 and 5 November, FDLR fighters
killed 13 people in Misau and Misoke villages,
Walikale territory, North Kivu.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Rape and other forms of sexual violence
against women and girls remained endemic,
not only in areas of conflict, but also in
parts of the country not affected by armed
hostilities. Acts of sexual violence were
committed by armed groups, by members of
the security forces and by unarmed civilians.
The perpetrators of rape and other sexual
violence enjoyed virtually total impunity.
Mass rapes, in which dozens of women
and girls were sexually assaulted with extreme
brutality, were committed by armed groups
and by members of the security forces
during attacks on villages in remote areas,
particularly in North Kivu and Katanga. Such
attacks often also involved other forms of
torture, killings and looting.
Between 4 and 17 July, Mai Mai Simba
combatants reportedly raped at least 23
women and girls in Mangurejipa village and
mining sites located in surrounding areas in
Lubero territory, North Kivu.
In October, dozens of women and girls
were raped in Kansowe village, Mitwaba
territory, Katanga province by special
commando soldiers of the Congolese army
deployed there to fight the Mai Mai Bakata
Katanga armed group.
Between 3 and 5 November, at least
10 women were raped, allegedly by FDLR
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
fighters, in Misau and Misoke villages,
Walikale territory, North Kivu province.
CHILD SOLDIERS
Armed groups recruited children. Many
were subjected to sexual violence and cruel
and inhuman treatment while being used
as fighters, carriers, cooks, guides, spies
and messengers.
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE
The demise of the M23 armed group in
2013 facilitated the progressive closure of
camps for internally displaced people (IDPs)
around the city of Goma. However, due to
the upsurge of armed group violence against
civilians, new IDP camps had to be set up
for people fleeing human rights abuses. By
17 December, about 2.7 million people were
internally displaced within DRC. Most of the
displacement took place in connection with
the armed conflicts in North Katanga, North
Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri districts.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment were endemic
throughout the country, and often took place
during unlawful arrests and detention by state
security services. Some cases of death under
torture were reported. Police, intelligence
officers and members of the presidential
guard were all accused of responsibility for
torture and other ill-treatment.
COMMUNAL VIOLENCE
In Tanganyika district, Katanga, tensions
between the Batwa and Luba intensified and
led to a violent confrontation between the two
communities. This added to the insecurity
already caused by the activities of the armed
group Mai Mai Bakata Katanga. The violence
was marked by a deliberate targeting of
civilians and serious human rights abuses.
Members of both communities committed
killings, abductions and acts of sexual
violence. They used children in the violence
and burned down and looted houses.
129In June and July, more than 26 Batwa
women and girls were captured and raped
in Longa village, Kabalo territory, Katanga.
Another 37 women from the same village
were kidnapped and kept for sexual purposes
by alleged Luba militias in Luala. At least 36
more women were raped when they were
trying to flee to Nyunzu. UNFAIR TRIALS
IMPUNITY PRISON CONDITIONS
Impunity continued to fuel further human
rights violations and abuses. Efforts by
judicial authorities to increase the capacity
of the courts to deal with cases, including
cases involving human rights abuses, had
only limited success. Efforts to ensure
accountability for crimes under international
law committed by the Congolese army
and armed groups also achieved few
visible results.
The verdict in the trial for the mass rape of
more than 130 women and girls, murder and
looting committed in and around the eastern
town of Minova by Congolese soldiers fleeing
the advance of M23 rebels in November and
December 2012 was handed down on 5
May 2014. Despite overwhelming evidence
of mass rape in Minova, including victim
and witness testimonies, only two soldiers of
the 39 on trial were convicted of rape. Other
accused were convicted of murder, looting
and military offences.
The M23 leader, General Bosco Ntaganda,
had turned himself in at the US embassy in
Kigali in 2013 and asked to be transferred to
the International Criminal Court (ICC), which
had issued a warrant for his arrest in 2006.
Other M23 leaders in exile in Uganda and
Rwanda continued to enjoy impunity for the
crimes they had reportedly committed in
Rutshuru and Nyiragongo territories.
In May, parliament rejected a legislative
proposal on the domestication of the Rome
Statute of the ICC, along with a proposal
to create specialized criminal chambers to
deal with crimes under international law
committed before the entry into force of the
Rome Statute. The prison system continued to be under-
funded. Prisoners and detainees were held
in decaying facilities, with overcrowding and
unhygienic conditions. Dozens died as a
result of malnutrition and lack of appropriate
medical care.
Insecurity for inmates was increased by
the failure to separate women from men, pre-
trial detainees from convicted prisoners and
members of the military from civilians.
130
The judicial system was weak and suffered
from a lack of resources. The courts were
often not independent of outside influence
and corruption was widespread. Legal aid was
not available, so that many defendants did not
have a lawyer, and the rights of defendants
were frequently violated.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
The demise of the M23 armed group
contributed to some improvement in the
situation for human rights defenders in
Rutshuru and Nyiragongo territories.
However, human rights defenders and trade
unionists across the country continued
to face threats, intimidation and arrest by
state security services and armed groups.
Some were forced to flee after they received
repeated death threats through text
messages, anonymous phone calls, and visits
at night by armed men.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Arbitrary arrests and detentions continued to
be routine throughout the country. Security
services, in particular the national police,
the intelligence services and the national
army, carried out arbitrary arrests. They
also frequently extorted money and items of
value from civilians during law enforcement
operations or at checkpoints.
A number of political opposition supporters
who attended demonstrations calling for
political dialogue and protesting against
Amnesty International Report 2014/15attempts to amend the Constitution were
arbitrarily arrested and ill-treated.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Freedom of expression was significantly
curtailed. In particular, opposition to the
prospective amendment of the Constitution
was severely repressed. Peaceful meetings
and demonstrations were routinely banned or
violently disrupted by the security services.
The main targets of repression were
political opponents, members of civil society
organizations and journalists. Some were
arrested and ill-treated, some imprisoned
after unfair trials on trumped-up charges.
For example, one political opponent of the
government – Jean Bertrand Ewanga of
the opposition party Union pour la Nation
Congolaise (UNC) – was imprisoned on
charges of insulting the President. The Canal
Futur television station, reportedly owned by
opposition leader Vital Kamerhe, remained
closed by the authorities throughout the year.
On 16 October, following the release by the
UN Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO)
of a report on extrajudicial executions and
enforced disappearances during a police
operation in Kinshasa, Scott Campbell, Head
of the UNJHRO, was declared persona non
grata by the Minister of the Interior and
expelled from the DRC. 2 Other UNJHRO
officials also reported receiving threats after
the report’s publication.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
More than 170,000 DRC nationals were
expelled from the Republic of Congo to the
DRC between 4 April and early September.
Among them were refugees and asylum-
seekers. Some of the expelled were allegedly
arrested and detained incommunicado
in Kinshasa.
Little assistance was provided by the DRC
government, and as of September, more
than 100 families were living on the streets of
Kinshasa without tents, health care, food or
any assistance.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
On 7 March, the ICC convicted Germain
Katanga, commander of the Force de
Résistance Patriotique en Ituri (FRPI), of
crimes against humanity and war crimes. The
crimes were committed on 24 February 2003
during an attack on the village of Bogoro, in
Ituri district. On 23 May, he was sentenced to
12 years’ imprisonment.
On 9 June, the International Criminal Court
(ICC) Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed charges
of war crimes and crimes against humanity
against Bosco Ntaganda allegedly committed
in 2002 and 2003 in Ituri district.
Sylvestre Mudacumura, alleged
commander of the armed branch of the
FDLR, remained at large despite the issuance
by the ICC of an arrest warrant for war crimes
on 13 July 2012.

DENMARK
Kingdom of Denmark
Head of state: Queen Margrethe II
Head of government: Helle Thorning-Schmidt
The government refused to investigate
allegations of unlawful surveillance
practices following revelations by US
whistleblower Edward Snowden. Legislation
was amended to criminalize sexual abuse by
a spouse. Asylum determination practices
for lesbian, gay and bisexual asylum-seekers
improved. Vulnerable asylum-seekers were
held in detention.
131COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In June 2013, following revelations by
whistleblower Edward Snowden about the US
National Security Agency’s mass surveillance
of data traffic in European countries in
co-operation with European intelligence
agencies, Danish MPs and the public called
on the Danish government to disclose
whether foreign intelligence agencies had
carried out or were carrying out surveillance
activities in Denmark and, if so, whether this
included surveillance of Danish citizens. The
government announced in response that
it did “not find reason to believe” that US
intelligence agencies were carrying out “illegal
surveillance activities targeting Denmark or
Danish interests”. The government refused to
investigate whether any such agencies had
operated or were operating on Danish territory
and to present an overview of the applicable
laws clarifying the distinction between lawful
and unlawful surveillance activities. The Refugee Appeals Board amended its
previous practice of refusing protection
to asylum-seekers who were at risk of
persecution at home due to their sexual
orientation on the basis that they should
“hide” their sexual identity. Since 2013,
lesbian, gay and bisexual asylum-seekers at
risk of persecution on grounds of the overall
homophobic practices of their country of
origin have been granted refugee status.
Since September 2013, asylum-
seekers from areas in Syria affected by
the ongoing armed conflict have been
granted refugee status without any further
individual assessment. In October 2014, the
government presented a bill to introduce a
temporary protection permit for all Syrian
asylum-seekers. The bill proposed that family
reunification procedures not be initiated
during the first 12 months of the asylum-
seekers’ stay in Denmark.
Vulnerable people – including victims
of torture, unaccompanied minors and
persons with mental illness – continued to be
detained for immigration control purposes.
The government maintained that the present
practice of screening by a nurse of all asylum-
seekers was sufficient to identify people who
are unfit to be placed in detention.
In October, the Eastern High Court found
that the “tolerated stay” of Elias Karkavandi,
an Iranian citizen, had over time become
“disproportionate”. Elias Karkavandi’s refugee
status had been revoked in 2007 following
the completion of a custodial sentence for
drugs offences; he had spent seven years
under the so-called “tolerated stay” regime,
which barred him indefinitely from working,
studying, marrying and living outside a
designated reception centre.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
In October, a joint working group of the
National Police and the Police Trade Union
presented a report on the introduction of
identification numbers on police uniforms.
The proposals lacked clarity on the visibility
required of any such identification numbers.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
In June 2013, Parliament amended the
criminal code to criminalize sexual abuse by
a spouse where the victim was in a “helpless
state” and to annul the possibility of reduced
or rescinded criminal punishment if the
perpetrator and the victim marry each other
or remain married after a rape.
The government did not take steps to
establish a national plan to improve the
rights of and support to rape victims. Nor
did it move to investigate the reason for the
disproportionately high rate of attrition in
investigating and prosecuting reported rapes.
132
Amnesty International Report 2014/15DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC
Dominican Republic
Head of state and government: Danilo Medina
Sánchez
The number of killings by police rose again.
Most people of Haitian descent remained
stateless following a September 2013
judgement by the Constitutional Court.
Violence against women and girls remained
widespread. Parliament failed to adopt
legislation that could have advanced the
protection of the rights of women and girls.
BACKGROUND
In September 2013, the Constitutional Court
issued a widely criticized judgement (TC
0168-13) which had the effect of retroactively
and arbitrarily depriving Dominicans of
foreign descent born between 1929 and
2010 of their Dominican nationality; the vast
majority of those affected were of Haitian
descent. This sparked an outcry at national
and international levels, including by the
Haitian authorities. As a consequence, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti held a number
of high-level bi-national meetings to discuss
several issues of common interest, including
migration and nationality.
The first Human Rights Ombudsman was
appointed in May 2013, 12 years after the
institution was established by law. However,
a number of human rights organizations
filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court
challenging the constitutionality of the
appointment. A ruling was pending at the
end of 2014. The Ombudsman dealt with
a number of cases, but failed to carry out
a public information campaign about her
Office’s role.
In June, the UN Human Rights Council
examined the Dominican Republic’s
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
human rights record under the Universal
Periodic Review.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
The police continued to kill large numbers
of people, often in circumstances suggesting
that the killings may have been unlawful.
Between January and June, the number of
killings increased by 13% compared with
the same period in 2013. 1 Allegations of
torture and other ill-treatment by the police
continued to be reported.
Although the Dominican Republic
adopted the UPR recommendations aimed
at expediting a comprehensive reform of the
police, the adoption of a law reforming the
police was not finalized. The National Security
Plan, which was formally launched in March
2013, was not made public and there were
no progress reports on its implementation.
IMPUNITY
Many police officers alleged to have
committed abuses were not brought to justice
despite compelling evidence. The authorities
failed to investigate the disappearance of
three men – Gabriel Sandi Alistar, Juan
Almonte Herrera and Randy Vizcaíno
González – who were last seen in police
custody in July 2009, September 2009 and
December 2013 respectively.
The Office of the Prosecutor General
reopened the investigation into the
disappearance of Narciso González following
a 2012 ruling by the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights establishing the responsibility
of the state. However, no significant progress
had been made by the end of 2014.
DISCRIMINATION – DOMINICO-HAITIANS
A law introduced into Parliament by the
President in response to the debate sparked
by Constitutional judgement TC 0168-13 was
adopted in May 2014 (Law 169/14). However,
the law failed to provide for Dominican
nationality to be automatically restored to
those who had it under the domestic legal
system in force between 1929 and 2010. 2
133In particular, the law established that those
who had been registered at some point in
the Dominican civil registry (group A) could
access Dominican nationality after undergoing
a process of regularization by the Central
Electoral Board. However, the law obliges
those who were never registered (group B) to
undergo a lengthy process that requires them
to register as foreigners, participate in the
National Regularization Plan for Foreigners
with Irregular Migration Status and then
apply for naturalization two years later. Poor
implementation of the law meant that only a
minority of those belonging to group A were
able to have their Dominican nationality
recognized and only a few of those in group B
were able to be registered. As a consequence,
thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent
remained stateless and continued to be
prevented from exercising their human
rights. In October, the Inter-American Court
of Human Rights found that judgement TC
0168-13 and part of Law 169-14 violated the
American Convention on Human Rights. 3
In November, the Constitutional Court
issued a judgement declaring the state’s
acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights invalid. 4
The Dominican authorities rejected all the
recommendations to guarantee the right to a
nationality and to adopt measures to identify,
prevent and reduce statelessness.
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
In December 2013, the government
launched the National Regularization Plan
for Foreigners with Irregular Migration Status.
Following a first preparatory phase, the
second phase of the plan started on 1 June
2014, giving migrants 12 months to apply for
regularization. By 30 September only 200 out
of the 68,814 people who applied had been
regularized. According to migrants’ rights
organizations, the small number was due to
migrants facing difficulties in gathering the
required, and costly, documentation and to
the inadequate processing of applications by
134
public officials, especially in the initial stages
of the process.
The decree launching the National
Regularization Plan banned the deportation of
migrants who had applied for regularization.
However, despite this, Dominican human
rights organizations continued to report
arbitrary mass repatriations throughout
the year.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
In the first six months of 2014, the number
of gender-based killings increased by 53%
compared with the same period in 2013. The
Office of the Prosecutor General reported
a substantive increase in the number
of convictions in cases of gender-based
violence and in July adopted a protocol for
the investigation of gender-based killings.
Women’s rights groups continued to criticize
the lack of coordination among relevant
national institutions, the inadequacy of the
budget allocated to preventing and punishing
gender-based violence, and the failure to
implement the agreed protocols for the
provision of care to victims of gender-based
violence. Parliament had yet to adopt a
comprehensive law to prevent and address
violence against women which had been
approved by the Senate in 2012.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
In September, the Lower Chamber started
considering a draft law on sexual and
reproductive health, which had been
drafted with the participation of women’s
rights groups.
Following a veto by the President of
the Republic on the proposed reform of
the Criminal Code, which maintained full
criminalization of abortion, on 16 December
the Congress adopted amendments
decriminalizing abortions where pregnancy
posed a risk to the life of a pregnant woman
or girl, in cases where the foetus would be
unable to survive outside the womb, and in
cases where the pregnancy was the result
of rape or incest. The reform of the Criminal
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Code was enacted on 19 December and is
supposed to enter into force within a year. 5 ECUADOR
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS Republic of Ecuador
Head of state and government: Rafael Vicente

Local NGOs continued to report cases of
forced evictions and excessive use of force by
police in some instances.
The latest version of the proposed
amendments to the Penal Code criminalized
the occupation of private property, sparking
concerns that, if adopted, these provisions
could be used to legitimize forced evictions.

Human rights defenders and government
critics continued to be attacked and
discredited. The right of Indigenous Peoples
to consultation and to free, prior and
informed consent was not fulfilled.
BACKGROUND
Mass protests in opposition to government
policies remained common. In July,
Indigenous groups marched to the capital
Quito to protest against the approval of a new
law regulating water resources, which they
claimed did not address all of their concerns.
In November 2013, the National Court
upheld a ruling against US oil company
Chevron for environmental damage. The
court ruled that Chevron was liable to pay
over US$9.5 billion to the Amazon Indigenous
communities affected. In March, following a
lawsuit filed by Chevron in the USA, a federal
court blocked US courts from being used
to collect the amount granted for rainforest
damage, stating that the Ecuadorean court
judgment was obtained by corrupt means. In
October, victims of Chevron’s environmental
damage sued the company’s directors before
the International Criminal Court.
Sixty people, including six police officers
accused of attempting to kill the President,
were convicted of involvement in police
protests over pay cuts in 2010, which were
regarded by the government as an attempted
coup. Another 36 were acquitted.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders continued to be
attacked and discredited.
The Indigenous and environmental
rights organization Fundación Pachamama
remained closed, having been shut down
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
135by the authorities in December 2013 using
an executive decree granting the authorities
wide powers to monitor and dissolve NGOs.
Days before the closure, members of
Fundación Pachamama had participated in a
demonstration outside the Ministry of Energy.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
In October the government apologized to the
Kichwa People of Sarayaku, accepting that
the state had put their lives and livelihoods at
risk when in 2002 and 2003 it allowed an oil
company to conduct exploration work in their
territory. The Kichwa People of Sarayaku had
won a legal battle before the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights in 2012. However, at
the end of 2014 Ecuador had not yet finalized
the removal of 1.4 tons of explosives left in
the Indigenous community’s territory and
had not regulated the right to consultation
and free, prior and informed consent for all
Indigenous Peoples as ordered by the Inter-
American Court in 2012.
Government plans to exploit oil resources
in Yasuni National Park, home to the Tagaeri
and Taromenane Indigenous communities,
continued to provoke public protests. In
May, the Confederacion Kichwa del Ecuador
(Ecuarunari), one of the country’s main
Indigenous organizations, presented a legal
action before the Constitutional Court arguing
that the government was not complying
with precautionary measures granted by
the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights in 2006 in favour of the Tagaeri and
Taromenane Indigenous communities. At the
end of 2014 the Constitutional Court had not
ruled on the legal action.
REPRESSION OF DISSENT
The authorities continued to clamp down on
anti-government protests, in what appeared to
be attempts to deter opposition.
In September over 100 protesters were
detained for up to 15 days for taking part
in anti-government demonstrations, amid
reports of clashes between protesters and the
police. Dozens of detainees complained of
136
ill-treatment during arrest and while in police
custody. Medical reports stated that scores of
those detained had bruising and other injuries
caused by blunt instruments. At the end of
the year no investigation into these allegations
had begun and the President publicly
rejected the allegations.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In January, El Universo newspaper and
caricaturist Javier Bonilla (known as Bonil)
were fined and forced to retract the content of
a caricature, under a 2013 Communications
Law. The caricature portrayed police officers
abruptly raiding the house of journalist
Fernando Villavicencio, an outspoken critic
of the government. Fernando Villavicencio
was one of three men convicted in 2013
for slander against the President and given
prison sentences of between 18 months and
six years, later reduced to between six and 12
months. At the end of 2014 Villavicencio and
one of the other men remained at large.
IMPUNITY
In December 2013, the National Assembly
passed a law guaranteeing the right to
reparation to relatives and victims of human
rights violations between 1983 and 2008
documented by the Truth Commission
established in 2007.
In January 2014, former Police Chief
Edgar Vaca was arrested in the USA pending
his extradition. Edgar Vaca was one of 10
former police and military officers accused
of torture and enforced disappearances
during Febres Cordero’s presidency (1984
to 1988). This was the first case of members
of the security forces being tried for crimes
against humanity.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
The New Penal Code enacted in January
maintained the criminalization of abortion in
case of rape unless the victim has a mental
disability. Attempts to decriminalize abortion
for all rape victims met with strong opposition
from the President, who threatened to resign
Amnesty International Report 2014/15if such a proposal was even discussed in
the National Assembly. The proposal was
withdrawn and three Congress members of
the ruling party were sanctioned.
EGYPT
Arab Republic of Egypt
Head of state: Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (replaced Adly
Mansour in June)
Head of government: Ibrahim Mahlab (replaced
Hazem Beblawi in March)
The year saw a continued dramatic
deterioration in human rights following the
ousting of President Mohamed Morsi in July
2013. The government severely restricted
freedoms of expression, association and
assembly. Thousands were arrested and
detained as part of a sweeping crackdown
on dissent, with some detainees subjected
to enforced disappearance. The Muslim
Brotherhood remained banned and its
leaders were detained and jailed. Torture
and other ill-treatment of detainees
remained routine and was committed with
impunity. Hundreds were sentenced to
prison terms or to death after grossly unfair
trials. Security forces used excessive force
against protesters and committed unlawful
killings with impunity. Women faced
discrimination and violence. Some refugees
were forcibly returned. Forced evictions
continued. Dozens of people faced arrest
and prosecution for their sexual orientation
or identity. Courts imposed hundreds of
death sentences; the first executions since
2011 were carried out in June.
BACKGROUND
Presidential elections in May saw former
army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi elected as
President. He took office in June, and in
September pledged to uphold freedom of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
expression, judicial independence and the
rule of law in a speech to the UN General
Assembly. In practice, his government
clamped down on free expression, widened
the jurisdiction of military courts to try
civilians, and allowed security forces to use
torture and excessive force with impunity.
Over 1,400 people were killed in protests
between July 2013, when Mohamed Morsi
was ousted as President, and the end of
2014. The vast majority were killed by security
forces dispersing sit-ins by Morsi supporters
at Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda Squares
in Greater Cairo on 14 August 2013. The
crackdown also saw the arrest and detention
or imprisonment of at least 16,000 people,
according to official estimates published by
the Associated Press news agency, with the
activist group Wikithawra later estimating
that over 40,000 people had been detained,
charged or indicted. Most of those detained
were Muslim Brotherhood supporters but they
also included left-wing and secular activists
and other government critics.
An upsurge in lethal attacks on the
security forces by armed groups led to the
deaths of at least 445 soldiers and security
officers, according to official statements. Most
attacks took place in Sinai, where at least
238 security forces officers were killed. After
renewed attacks in October, the government
declared a state of emergency in North
Sinai, imposed a curfew, closed Egypt’s
border with Gaza, and began constructing a
“buffer” zone along it. Military reinforcements
launched a “combing” operation to identify
what they called “militants” within the area’s
population, posing a risk of further human
rights violations. 1
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
Members of the UN Human Rights Council
examined Egypt’s human rights record under
the UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR)
mechanism in November, recommending
that the authorities combat torture, investigate
excessive use of force by security forces,
and lift restrictions on civil society. With
137the exception of the UPR, Egypt largely
evaded international scrutiny in spite of
the deteriorating human rights situation in
the country.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The authorities targeted those who criticized
the government or expressed dissent. Media
workers who documented rights violations or
questioned the authorities’ political narrative
faced arrest and prosecution. Journalists who
reported on army activities faced unfair trials
before military courts. 2
In June, a court in Cairo sentenced three
staff members of the Al Jazeera English
television station to between seven and 10
years’ imprisonment after a grossly unfair
trial. The court convicted Mohamed Fahmy,
a Canadian-Egyptian dual national; Peter
Greste, an Australian; and Baher Mohamed,
an Egyptian, on charges that included aiding
the Muslim Brotherhood and reporting “false”
news. The prosecution failed to produce
any substantive evidence against them, or
against other media workers who were tried in
their absence.
Some individuals faced prosecution and
imprisonment on charges such as “inciting
sectarian strife” and/or “defamation of
religion”. The authorities also increased
monitoring of social media.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
The authorities shut down groups linked to
the banned Muslim Brotherhood group and
other centres of opposition, and imposed
onerous new restrictions on human rights
organizations.
In April, the 6 April Youth Movement,
one of the activist groups that led the 2011
uprising, was banned by a court which ruled
that some of its members had committed
offences that would “disturb peace and
public order”.
In August, a court dissolved the Freedom
and Justice Party, which was founded
by the Muslim Brotherhood and won the
138
largest number of seats in Egypt’s 2012
parliamentary elections.
Human rights organizations faced threats
of closure and criminal prosecution, forcing
many activists to scale down their work
or leave the country. In July, the Ministry
of Social Solidarity gave NGOs a 45-day
deadline, later extended to November,
to register under the repressive Law on
Associations (Law 84 of 2002), warning that
it would hold groups that failed to register
“accountable”. The Ministry later announced
that it would deal with NGOs on a case-by-
case basis, following criticism from other
states during Egypt’s UPR.
The authorities disrupted peaceful NGO
activities, raiding the Alexandria offices of
the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social
Rights in May when it held a conference to
support detained human rights activists.
In September, the government amended
the Penal Code to prohibit the funding of
acts harmful to Egypt’s national interest,
territorial integrity or public peace. The
government also proposed a new Law on
Associations that, if enacted, would give the
authorities additional powers to deny NGOs
legal registration and curtail their activities
and funding.
In November, Egypt’s Cabinet approved
draft legislation which, if passed, would give
the authorities sweeping powers to classify
organizations as terrorist entities.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Security forces ruthlessly suppressed
protests, and courts jailed scores of people for
protesting without authorization, among them
supporters of Mohamed Morsi, prominent
opposition activists, and left-wing and human
rights activists. 3 The authorities continued
to enforce Law 107 of 2013 on protests,
which required demonstrations to have prior
authorization; security forces used excessive
force against peaceful protesters.
Women university students Abrar Al-Anany
and Menatalla Moustafa, and a woman
teacher, Yousra Elkhateeb, were jailed in May
Amnesty International Report 2014/15for between two and six years for protesting
peacefully at Mansoura University.
In November, a court in Alexandria
sentenced 78 children to prison terms of
between two and five years after convicting
them of participating in an unauthorized
protest in support of Mohamed Morsi.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Thousands of actual and suspected
government opponents were arrested during
protests, at their homes or on the street.
Many were not informed of the reason for
their arrest and were arbitrarily detained and
held in pre-trial detention for periods that in
some cases exceeded one year, or else were
brought before the courts and sentenced to
lengthy prison terms after unfair trials. Many
were also beaten or ill-treated during arrest
or in detention. In some instances, security
forces seized family members or friends if the
wanted person was not present.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Some detainees were subjected to enforced
disappearance and held in secret detention
at Al Azouly Prison within the Al Galaa
military camp in Ismailia, 130km northeast
of Cairo. Detainees were held at Al Galaa
without official acknowledgement and were
denied access to lawyers and their families.
Detainees, who included alleged protest
leaders and people accused of terrorism-
related offences, were held at the camp
for up to 90 days without judicial oversight
and faced torture and other ill-treatment
by military intelligence and National
Security Agency (NSA) officers to extract
“confessions”. Public prosecutors told
families of the disappeared that they had no
jurisdiction over military prisons.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment of criminal
suspects was routinely used to extract
confessions and punish and humiliate
suspects. It reportedly led to several deaths of
detainees. NSA officials particularly targeted
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
members and alleged supporters of the
Muslim Brotherhood, some of whom they
held and reportedly tortured in unofficial
detention facilities, including NSA offices
across the country.
Commonly reported methods of torture
included electric shocks to the genitals and
other sensitive areas, beating, suspension
by the limbs while handcuffed from behind,
stress positions, beatings and rape.
Al Azhar university student Omar Gamal El
Shewiekh said that security officials arrested
and tortured him after he participated in a
protest in Cairo in March. He said that NSA
officials subjected him to electric shocks and
repeatedly inserted objects into his anus until
he “confessed” to crimes on video. In May a
court sentenced him to five years in prison on
the basis of the forced “confession”.
Deaths in detention were reported, with
some apparently attributable to torture or
other ill-treatment or inadequate conditions in
police stations. 4
Ezzat Abdel Fattah died in Cairo’s
Mattareya Police Station in May. A post-
mortem report issued by the forensic authority
found that he had injuries that included nine
broken ribs, cuts and concussion.
The authorities failed to conduct genuine
investigations into allegations of torture. When
prosecutors did investigate, they generally
closed cases citing lack of evidence. In
some cases, victims and their families said
that police threatened them to make them
withdraw torture allegations.
IMPUNITY
The criminal justice system failed to hold any
members of the security forces accountable
for gross human rights violations committed
during the 2013 unrest, including the mass
killings of pro-Morsi protesters at Rabaa
al-Adawiya and al-Nahda Squares on 14
August 2013. On 7 June, an appeals court
quashed the verdicts against four police
officers convicted of killing 37 detainees in
August 2013.
139A court retrying former President Hosni
Mubarak on charges of killing protesters
during the 2011 uprising dismissed the
case against him in November on a legal
technicality. His Interior Minister and several
security officials were also acquitted of the
same charges.
A government-appointed fact-finding
committee, established after security forces
killed hundreds of protesters on 14 August
2013, announced its findings in November.
Ignoring disparities between security forces
casualties and protesters, it concluded
that protesters had started the violence.
The committee downplayed human rights
violations by security forces, merely calling
for them to receive training in policing
demonstrations.
UNFAIR TRIALS
Courts throughout Egypt sentenced hundreds
of Muslim Brotherhood and other opposition
activists to long prison terms or to death after
grossly unfair trials, often on trumped-up
charges. Courts also sentenced children to
death in contravention of international and
Egyptian law.
Former President Mohamed Morsi faced
four trials, including for capital offences.
Other senior members of the Muslim
Brotherhood were imprisoned and sentenced
to death.
Trials before the criminal courts were
riddled with due process violations. Some
trials proceeded in the absence of the
defendants and their lawyers . In others,
judges prevented defendants or their lawyers
from presenting evidence in their own
defence or cross-examining prosecution
witnesses. In many cases, courts convicted
defendants despite an absence of substantive
evidence against them.
Many trials were conducted within the Tora
Police Institute, adjacent to the Tora Prison
Complex, with families and independent
media unable to attend. Defendants were also
unable to communicate with their lawyers
140
during court sessions because they were
confined behind a dark glass screen.
The Public Prosecution increasingly did
not seek to determine individual criminal
responsibility, instead bringing identical
charges against groups of accused, and relied
heavily on reports and testimonies by police
and security forces. The impartiality and
independence of the investigations were thus
brought into question.
In October, President al-Sisi decreed that
military courts could try civilians for offences
against “vital public facilities”. It was feared
that the decision would see a return to
mass unfair trials of civilians before military
courts, including peaceful protesters and
university students.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women continued to face discrimination in
law and in practice, including high levels of
gender-based violence.
In June, outgoing President Adly Mansour
approved a law to combat sexual harassment.
Renewed sexual assaults by mobs of men
against women in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during
President al-Sisi’s inauguration spurred the
new administration to promise action. The
authorities announced measures to combat
violence against women, including improved
policing and public awareness-raising
campaigns; however, such measures had not
materialized by the end of the year.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Men suspected of having consensual sex with
other men, as well as transgender people,
faced arrest and prosecution on prostitution
and public morality charges under the Law on
Debauchery (Law 10 of 1961). The authorities
subjected some to forcible anal examinations,
which violate the prohibition on torture and
other ill-treatment.
Security forces arrested over 30 men in
a raid on a Cairo bathhouse in November,
and the trial of 26 of the men on charges of
“debauchery” began in December.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In a separate case, eight men received
three-year prison terms in November for
attending an alleged same-sex wedding on a
Nile riverboat. An appeals court reduced their
prison sentences to one year in December.
DISCRIMINATION –
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES
The authorities failed to tackle discrimination
against religious minorities, including Coptic
Christians, Shi’a Muslims and Baha’is. Coptic
Christian communities, in particular, reported
new sectarian attacks and faced restrictions
on building and maintaining their places
of worship.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
Security forces forcibly evicted thousands
of people from their homes in Cairo and
Rafah, without informing them in advance
or providing them with alternative housing or
adequate compensation. 5
first executions since 2011 were carried out
in June.
A court in El-Minya, Upper Egypt,
sentenced 37 defendants to death in
April, including at least two children, and
a further 183 defendants to death in June
after grossly unfair trials arising from attacks
on police stations in 2013. 6 The court had
recommended the death penalty for over
1,200 defendants but reversed its decisions
after consulting the Grand Mufti, a legal
process that must take place under Egyptian
law before a court formally hands down
its sentence.

REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
The authorities failed to respect the rights of
refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants. In
August, they forcibly returned 13 Palestinian
refugees to Syria and 180 Syrians to Syria,
Lebanon and Turkey. At least six were
returned to Gaza in December. Other refugees
from Syria faced arbitrary arrest and were
unlawfully detained.
Security forces arrested refugees, asylum-
seekers and migrants who sought to enter
or leave Egypt irregularly, sometimes using
excessive force. Criminal groups operating in
Sinai also reportedly held refugees, asylum-
seekers and migrants captive.

DEATH PENALTY
people-death-new-purge-political-opposition/
The death penalty was used on an
unprecedented scale. The courts imposed
death sentences, many in the defendant’s
absence, after grossly unfair trials. Most of
those sentenced were convicted of taking
part in violence during political unrest in
2013. They included many members and
supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. The
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
141EL SALVADOR
Republic of El Salvador
Head of state and government: Salvador Sánchez
Cerén (replaced Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena
in June)
The total abortion ban remained in place
and the implementation of legislation to
combat violence against women was still
weak. Impunity for human rights violations
committed during the 1980-1992 armed
conflict persisted, despite some steps to
combat it.
BACKGROUND
President Sánchez Cerén of the Farabundo
Martí National Liberation Front took office.
Violent crime rose sharply. Official sources
recorded 1,857 homicides in the first six
months of 2014; the figure for the same
period in 2013 was 1,048. The rise was
thought to be due to the reported collapse of
a truce between rival criminal gangs.
In June, the Legislative Assembly ratified
amendments to the Constitution formally
recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ rights and
the state’s obligations to uphold them.
The ratifications of key international
agreements, including ILO Convention No.
169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court, the Optional Protocol to the Convention
against Torture, the International Convention
against enforced disappearance and the
Inter-American Convention on Forced
Disappearance of Persons, were still pending
at the end of the year.
During consideration of El Salvador’s
human rights record under the UN
Universal Periodic Review in October 2014,
states called on El Salvador to ratify these
international agreements. Several states also
recommended that El Salvador decriminalize
abortion and make safe abortion available,
particularly in cases where the life or health
142
of the woman was at risk or when the
pregnancy was the result of incest or rape.
Two states also recommended that women
incarcerated for undergoing abortion or
having a miscarriage be released. El Salvador
responded that it would examine these
recommendations and provide a response at
the next session of the Human Rights Council
in 2015.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Between January and September, the
police reported 216 killings of women,
compared with 215 for the whole of 2013. 1
This indicated that violence against women
was once more on the increase following
a period of sustained decrease since
2011. Despite some welcome progress in
the implementation of the 2012 Special
Comprehensive Law for a Life Free from
Violence for Women, few cases of killings
were prosecuted as the gender-based crime
of femicide.
A unified database recording violence
against women, provided for in the 2012
Special Law, was still not operational and only
one state shelter for women fleeing violent
partners was in place at the end of 2014.
In its 2014 report to the UN on the
progress of the Millennium Development
Goals, the government acknowledged that the
total abortion ban was hampering efforts to
reduce maternal mortality. Despite this, the
total ban on abortion remained in place at the
end of 2014. The state also acknowledged
that “socio-cultural” and economic factors,
lack of access to contraceptives and the
prevalence of violence against women and
girls were all impeding the achievement of
the Goals.
In December 2013, human rights
organizations presented a petition to the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
against the state for the grave human rights
violations suffered by a 22-year-old woman
known as “Beatriz”. Beatriz, who suffers
from lupus, had been refused an abortion
despite the imminent risk to her life and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the knowledge that the fetus, which lacked
part of its brain and skull, could not survive
outside the womb. Two months after she first
requested the medical treatment she needed,
and after 23 weeks of pregnancy, Beatriz was
given a caesarean. The fetus survived just a
few hours.
In April, after exhausting other legal
avenues, the Citizens Group for the
Decriminalization of Therapeutic, Ethical
and Eugenic Abortion presented a petition
for a state pardon on behalf of 17 women,
who were incarcerated on pregnancy-related
grounds. They were serving sentences of
up to 40 years in prison for aggravated
homicide, having been initially charged with
having had an abortion. Their cases raised
serious concerns regarding the right to non-
discrimination, as well as the rights to due
process and fair trial, including the right to
effective legal defence. The cases remained
pending at the end of 2014; Congress was
awaiting recommendations from the Supreme
Court of Justice before issuing its decision.
IMPUNITY
The 1993 Amnesty Law, which for over two
decades has ensured impunity for those
responsible for human rights violations during
the 1980-1992 conflict, remained in place.
Tutela Legal, the Catholic Archbishopric’s
human rights office, was shut down without
warning in September 2013. There were
serious concerns that its extensive archive
of evidence relating to unresolved human
rights cases dating back to the internal armed
conflict might not be preserved. Survivors and
relatives of the victims submitted a habeas
corpus challenge to get access to the files; the
case was pending before the Supreme Court
at the end of 2014.
The office of the human rights organization
Pro-Búsqueda, which works to find
children who were the victims of enforced
disappearance during the conflict years, was
raided by three armed men in November
2013. During the raid, three staff members
were held captive while information was set
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
on fire and computers containing sensitive
information on cases were stolen. The stolen
computers contained information on three
cases of enforced disappearance that were
before the Supreme Court. Days before
the attack, military officials accused of
involvement in the disappearances failed to
attend a hearing in one of the cases. 2
At end of 2013, the Attorney General’s
Office reopened the investigation into the
1981 El Mozote massacre in which more
than 700 civilians, including children and
elderly people, were tortured and killed by
the military in the village of El Mozote and
nearby hamlets over a three-day period.
The investigation was continuing at the end
of 2014.
In October 2013, the authorities issued a
decree establishing a reparations programme
for survivors who suffered human rights
violations during the conflict.
In February 2014, the Supreme Court
ordered that an investigation be reopened into
the San Francisco Angulo massacre in which
45 people, mostly women and children, were
killed, allegedly by members of the army, in
1981. The investigation was continuing at the
end of the year.
In August, 32 years after the events,
the state finally acknowledged the 1982 El
Calabozo massacre, in which more than 200
people were killed by the army. However, no
one had been brought to justice for the crime
by the end of 2014.
In October, in its ruling in the case of
Rochac Hernandez et al. v. El Salvador, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights found
the state responsible for failing to investigate
the enforced disappearance of five children
between 1980 and 1982 in the context of
military counter-insurgency operations during
the conflict .

EQUATORIAL
GUINEA
Republic of Equatorial Guinea
Head of state and government: Teodoro Obiang
Nguema Mbasogo
Nine prisoners were executed in January
shortly before a temporary moratorium on
the death penalty was declared. Detainees
and prisoners were routinely tortured.
Several political opponents were arbitrarily
arrested and held incommunicado for long
periods without charge, including one man
abducted from a neighbouring country
by Equatorial Guinea security forces in
December 2013. Military courts were used
to try civilians.
BACKGROUND
In February President Obiang signed a
decree establishing a temporary moratorium
on the death penalty, apparently to secure
full membership of the Community of
Portuguese-speaking Countries. Equatorial
Guinea was granted full membership in
July at the organization’s summit in Dili,
East Timor.
In May, the UN Human Rights Council,
under its Universal Periodic Review process,
examined the human rights situation in
Equatorial Guinea and made a number of
recommendations. The government accepted
most recommendations in principle, but
rejected those urging ratification of the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court.
In October, President Obiang decreed
a general amnesty for all those convicted
or indicted for political crimes. This was
144
one of the demands made by opposition
political parties for their participation in a
national dialogue in November. However,
no prisoners were released and President
Obiang stated that all convicted prisoners
had been convicted of common crimes. In
November, three independent opposition
parties withdrew from the national dialogue
on the basis that their demands, including the
release of prisoners, had not been met.
DEATH PENALTY
Nine men convicted of murder were
executed in late January, 13 days before the
establishment of a temporary moratorium
on the death penalty. This was the highest
number of people known to have been
executed in any one year over the past two
decades, and the first known executions
since 2010. 1
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture by the security forces continued
with impunity. Detainees and prisoners
were also subjected to other forms of cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment. Many
were held incommunicado for long periods
without charge or trial and denied adequate
medical treatment.
Cipriano Nguema Mba, a refugee in
Belgium since 2012, was abducted by
Equatorial Guinea security personnel in
December 2013 while visiting relatives in
Nigeria. He was taken clandestinely to the
National Security Headquarters in Malabo,
where he was tortured. His ankles and elbows
were tied together behind his back and he
was then suspended from a metal bar and his
whole body was beaten with batons. He was
held incommunicado throughout the year.
Roberto Berardi, an Italian businessman
in partnership with President Obiang’s eldest
son Teodoro “Teodorín” Nguema Obiang in
a civil construction company, was beaten
and tortured on several occasions since his
arrest in January 2013, first in Bata police
station and subsequently in Bata prison.
On one occasion, in January 2014, he was
Amnesty International Report 2014/15held down by prison guards and flogged.
Throughout the year he was held in solitary
confinement for long periods and was denied
medical treatment for typhoid fever and
emphysema. He was taken to hospital after
he became very ill in June, but was returned
to prison the following day against medical
advice. According to his lawyer, the purpose
of Roberto Berardi’s arrest was to prevent him
testifying before the US Justice Department
and other foreign jurisdictions about Teodorín
Nguema Obiang’s alleged corruption. He
remained in prison at the end of the year.
for 16 months without charge. He had been
arbitrarily arrested and detained in Bata in
October 2012 after exchanging money with
a foreign national and accused of attempting
to destabilize the country. His arrest and
detention were politically motivated and
unjustified. 2

ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Following Cipriano Nguema Mba’s abduction
(see above), in January, 11 people suspected
of having had contact with him, including
two women, were arrested without warrants
in Malabo, Mongomo and Ebebiyín, and held
incommunicado. Five of the male detainees
were released without charge in June. Four
of the remaining six people were still detained
incommunicado at the end of 2014. In
July, the military judicial authorities charged
Cipriano Nguema, Ticiano Obama Nkogo,
Timoteo Asumu, Antonio Nconi Sima, Leoncio
Abeso Meye (charged in his absence) and
the two women, Mercedes Obono Nconi and
Emilia Abeme Nzo, with “threatening state
security and the physical integrity of the
head of state”. According to their lawyers,
they were interrogated without their lawyers
present and were not informed of the charges
against them.
On 27 September they were tried by a
military court, again without their lawyers
present. Instead, they were allocated military
officers with no judicial training as their legal
counsel. Three days later they were convicted
as charged. Mercedes Obono and Timoteo
Asumu received 15-year custodial sentences,
while the other defendants were each
sentenced to 27 years’ imprisonment.

ERITREA
State of Eritrea
Head of state and government: Isaias Afewerki
No political opposition parties, independent
media, civil society organizations or
unregistered faith groups were permitted
to operate. There were severe restrictions
on freedom of expression and association.
Military conscription was compulsory, and
frequently extended indefinitely. Thousands
of prisoners of conscience and political
prisoners continued to be held in arbitrary
detention, in harsh conditions. Torture and
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
was common. Eritreans continued to flee the
country in large numbers.
BACKGROUND
On 21 January 2013, around 200 soldiers
took control of the Ministry of Information
in the capital, Asmara, in an apparent
coup attempt. The director of Eritrean state
television was forced to read a statement
on air containing the soldiers’ demands,
including freeing all political prisoners,
implementing the 1997 Constitution, and
145putting in place a transitional government.
The broadcast was cut off mid-transmission.
In July 2013, the UN Monitoring Group
on Somalia and Eritrea observed “emerging
fissures within the political and military
leadership” in Eritrea. In October 2014, they
also reported the continued use of coercive
measures to collect the “diaspora tax” (a 2%
levy on income imposed on Eritrean nationals
living abroad) in a number of countries.
After hundreds of Eritreans drowned
while trying to reach the Italian island of
Lampedusa in October 2013, four Eritrean
Catholic bishops issued a letter in May 2014.
In a rare public expression of dissent, they
criticized the situation that led so many
people to continue to leave the country.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
Thousands of people were arbitrarily detained
and held in incommunicado detention without
charge or trial for various reasons, including:
criticizing government policy or practice;
for their work as journalists; for suspected
opposition to the government; practising a
religion not recognized by the state; evading
or deserting national service conscription; or
for trying to flee the country, or in the place of
family members who had fled. In most cases
relatives were not aware of the detainee’s
whereabouts. Some prisoners of conscience
had been in prison without charge or trial for
two decades.
The government continued to refuse to
confirm reports that nine of the 11 so-called
G15 prisoners – a group of high-profile
politicians detained since 2001 – had died in
detention from a range of illnesses, as well as
a number of the journalists arrested alongside
them. There were unconfirmed reports
that eight detainees held since 2005/2006,
including government officials and medical
doctors, were released in April 2014.
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
Only four faith groups were permitted to
operate – the Eritrean Orthodox, Roman
Catholic and Lutheran Churches, and Islam.
146
Members of other banned groups, including
Pentecostal and Evangelical Christian
denominations, continued to be subject to
arbitrary detention and torture and other ill-
treatment for practising their religion.
MILITARY CONSCRIPTION
National service continued to be mandatory
for all men and women aged between 18
and 50, with no provision for conscientious
objection. All school pupils were required
to complete their final school year at Sawa
military camp, effectively conscripting
children into the military. The initial 18-month
period of service continued to be frequently
extended indefinitely, with minimal salaries
and no choice over the nature of work
assigned – a system that amounted to forced
labour. Conscripts faced harsh penalties
for evasion, including arbitrary detention
and torture and other ill-treatment. Children
at Sawa were kept in poor conditions and
received harsh punishments for infractions.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment was reported to
be widely used as punishment, interrogation,
and as coercion. Common methods included
tying prisoners in painful positions for long
periods and prolonged solitary confinement.
Appalling prison conditions amounted to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment. Many detainees were held in
overcrowded underground cells or metal
shipping containers, often in desert locations,
suffering extremes of heat and cold. Food,
water and sanitation were inadequate.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
As of January 2014 UNHCR, the UN refugee
agency, reported 338,129 persons of concern
originating from Eritrea, including 308,022
refugees and 30,038 asylum-seekers. Around
3,000 people fled the country each month.
Human trafficking networks continued
to prey upon Eritreans fleeing the country,
including in Sudan and Egypt. Victims were
held hostage, sometimes for a year or longer,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15and subjected to violence by criminal groups
attempting to extract ransom payments
from their families. The UN Monitoring
Group reported that it had identified a Swiss
bank account that had been used to collect
such payments.
In April 2014, 266 Eritrean refugees and
asylum-seekers were released from detention
in neighbouring Djibouti and transferred to a
refugee camp in the south of the country.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
Eritrea faced increased international scrutiny.
Appointed to the newly created role of UN
Special Rapporteur on the human rights
situation in Eritrea in October 2012, Sheila
Keetharuth presented wide-ranging concerns
and recommendations in reports to the UN
Human Rights Council in June 2013 and
June 2014, and to the UN General Assembly
in October 2013 and October 2014. The
Special Rapporteur’s requests for access to
the country have not been granted since her
appointment in 2012.
In June 2014, a three-member UN
Commission of Inquiry was established for
one year to investigate all alleged violations of
human rights in Eritrea outlined in the reports
of the Special Rapporteur.
ESTONIA
Republic of Estonia
Head of state: Toomas Hendrik Ilves
Head of government: Taavi Rõivas (replaced Andrus
Ansip in March)
Legislation allowing unmarried, including
same-sex, couples to register their
cohabitation was passed. About 91,000
people remained stateless. Few asylum-
seekers were granted protection and the
number of asylum applications remained
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
low. The government accepted the transfer
of a Guantánamo detainee.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
On 9 October, parliament passed a gender-
neutral Cohabitation Act, due to enter into
force on 1 January 2016. The Act allows
unmarried, including same-sex, couples to
register their cohabitation. It also extends to
them many of the rights of married couples,
for example regarding benefits. Couples
in a registered cohabitation agreement
will be allowed to adopt the partner’s
biological children.
DISCRIMINATION – ETHNIC MINORITIES
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, stated that
about 91,000 people (approximately 6.8% of
the population) remained stateless; the vast
majority were Russian speakers. Stateless
people enjoyed limited political rights.
Efforts by the authorities to facilitate the
naturalization of children born of stateless
parents fell short of granting them automatic
citizenship at birth, leaving Estonia in breach
of its obligations under the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Ethnic minorities continued to be
disproportionately affected by unemployment
and poverty, leading to concerns that ethnic
and linguistic discrimination could be a
contributing factor. Language requirements
for employment were reportedly placing
ethnic minorities at a disadvantage.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
The number of asylum applications remained
low. Approximately 120 were made in the
first 10 months of the year, of which some 35
were from Ukrainian nationals. At least 20
people had been granted asylum as of the
end of November. There was concern that
asylum-seekers could be denied access to
asylum at borders and refused entry.
147Reports indicated that the provision of
legal aid and interpretation to asylum-seekers
had improved.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
In October, following a request from the
USA, the government agreed to accept for
resettlement a former Guantánamo detainee.
Neither his identity nor the date of transfer
were disclosed.
ETHIOPIA
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia
Head of state: Mulatu Teshome Wirtu
Head of government: Hailemariam Desalegn
Freedom of expression continued to
be subject to serious restrictions. The
government was hostile to suggestions
of dissent, and often made pre-emptive
arrests to prevent dissent from manifesting.
Independent media publications were
subject to further attack. Peaceful
protesters, journalists, and members of
opposition political parties were arbitrarily
arrested. The Charities and Societies
Proclamation continued to obstruct the
work of human rights organizations.
Arbitrary detention and torture and other
ill-treatment were widespread, often used
as part of a system for silencing actual or
suspected dissent.
BACKGROUND
Economic growth continued apace, along with
significant foreign investment including in the
agriculture, construction and manufacturing
sectors, large-scale development projects
such as hydroelectric dam building and
plantations, and widespread land-leasing,
often to foreign companies.
The government used multiple channels
and methods to enforce political control on
148
the population, including politicizing access
to job and education opportunities and
development assistance, and high levels of
physical and technological surveillance.
The politicization of the investigative branch
of the police and of the judiciary meant that
it was not possible to receive a fair hearing in
politically motivated trials.
Federal and regional security services
were responsible for violations throughout the
country, including arbitrary arrests, the use
of excessive force, torture and extrajudicial
executions. They operated with near-
total impunity.
Armed opposition groups remained in
several parts of the country or in neighbouring
countries, although in most cases with small
numbers of fighters and low levels of activity.
Access to some parts of the Somali region
continued to be severely restricted. There
were continuing reports of serious violations
of human rights, including arbitrary arrests
and extrajudicial executions. There were also
multiple allegations of the rape of women and
girls by members of the security services.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE –
EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS
In April and May, protests took place across
Oromia region against a proposed “Integrated
Master Plan” to expand the capital Addis
Ababa into Oromia regional territory. The
government said the plan would bring
services to remote areas, but many Oromo
people feared it would damage the interests
of Oromo farmers and lead to large-scale
displacement.
Security services, comprising federal
police and military special forces, responded
with excessive force, firing live ammunition
at protesters in Ambo and Guder towns
and Wallega and Madawalabu universities,
resulting in the deaths of at least 30 people,
including children. Hundreds of people were
beaten by security service agents during
and after the protests, including protesters,
bystanders, and parents of protesters for
Amnesty International Report 2014/15failing to “control” their children, resulting in
scores of injuries.
Thousands of people were arbitrarily
arrested. Large numbers were detained
without charge for several months, and
some were held incommunicado. Hundreds
were held in unofficial places of detention,
including Senkele police training camp. Some
detainees were transferred to Maikelawi
federal police detention centre in Addis
Ababa. Over 100 people continued to be
detained in Kelem Wallega, Jimma and Ambo
by security service agents after courts ordered
their release on bail or unconditionally.
Many of those arrested were released
after varying detention periods, between May
and October, but others were denied bail, or
remained in detention without charge. Others,
including students and members of the
Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) opposition
political party, were prosecuted and convicted
in rapid trials on various charges relating to
the protests.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, ARBITRARY
ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
2014 saw another onslaught on freedom
of expression and suggestions of dissent,
including further targeting of the independent
media and arrests of opposition political party
members and peaceful protesters. Several
attempts by opposition political parties to
stage demonstrations were obstructed by the
authorities. The Anti-Terrorism Proclamation
continued to be used to silence dissidents.
Opposition party members were increasingly
targeted ahead of the 2015 general election.
In late April, six bloggers of the Zone 9
collective and three independent journalists
associated with the group were arrested
in Addis Ababa, two days after the group
announced the resumption of activities,
which had been suspended due to significant
harassment. For nearly three months, all
nine were held in the underground section of
Maikelawi, denied access to family members
and other visitors, and with severely restricted
access to lawyers.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In July, they were charged with terrorism
offences, along with another Zone 9 member
charged in their absence. The charge sheet
cited among their alleged crimes the use of
“Security in a Box” – a selection of open-
source software and materials created to
assist human rights defenders, particularly
those working in repressive environments.
Six of the group said they were forced
to sign confessions. Three complained
in remand hearings that they had been
tortured, but the court did not investigate their
complaints. The trial continued at the end
of 2014.
Early in 2014, a “study” conducted by the
national Press Agency and Ethiopian News
Agency and published in the government-
run Addis Zemen newspaper targeted
seven independent publications, alleging
that they had printed several articles which
“promoted terrorism”, denied economic
growth, belittled the legacy of former Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi, and committed
other “transgressions”. In August, the
government announced that it was bringing
charges against several of the publications,
causing over 20 journalists to flee the
country. In October, the owners of three of
the publications were sentenced in their
absence to over three years’ imprisonment
each for allegedly inciting the public to
overthrow the government and publishing
unfounded rumours.
The OFC opposition party reported that
between 350 and 500 of its members were
arrested between May and July, including
party leadership. The arrests started in
the context of the “Master Plan” protests,
but continued for several months. Many of
those arrested were detained arbitrarily and
incommunicado. OFC members were among
over 200 people arrested in Oromia in mid-
September, and further party members were
arrested in October.
On 8 July, Habtamu Ayalew and Daniel
Shebeshi, of the Unity for Democracy and
Justice (UDJ) Party, and Yeshewas Asefa of
the Semayawi Party were arrested in Addis
149Ababa. Abraha Desta of the Arena Tigray
Party, and a lecturer at Mekele University,
was arrested in Tigray, and was transferred
to Addis Ababa. They were detained in
Maikelawi and initially denied access to
lawyers and family. In late October, they
were charged under the Anti-Terrorism
Proclamation. Yeshewas Asefa complained in
court that he had been tortured in detention.
The Semayawi Party reported numerous
arrests of its members, including seven
women arrested in March during a run to
mark International Women’s Day in Addis
Ababa, along with three men, also members
of the party. They had been chanting slogans
including “We need freedom! Free political
prisoners!” They were released without charge
after 10 days. In late April, 20 members of
the party were arrested while promoting a
demonstration in Addis Ababa. They were
released after 11 days.
In early September, Befekadu Abebe and
Getahun Beyene, party officials in Arba Minch
city, were arrested along with three party
members. Befekadu Abebe and Getahun
Beyene were transferred to Maikelawi
detention centre in Addis Ababa. In the initial
stages of detention, they were reportedly
denied access to lawyers and family
members. In late October, party member
Agbaw Setegn, was arrested in Gondar, and
was also transferred to Maikelawi, and held
incommunicado without access to lawyers
or family.
On 27 October, editor Temesgen Desalegn
was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment
for “defamation” and “inciting the public
through false rumours”, in the now-defunct
publication Feteh, after a trial that had lasted
more than two years. The publisher of Feteh
was also convicted in their absence.
People were detained arbitrarily without
charge for long periods in the initial stages,
or throughout the duration, of their detention
including numerous people arrested for
peaceful opposition to the government or
their imputed political opinion. Arbitrary
detention took place in official and unofficial
150
detention centres, including Maikelawi. Many
detainees were held incommunicado, and
many were denied access to lawyers and
family members.
Numerous prisoners of conscience,
imprisoned in previous years based solely on
their peaceful exercise of their freedom of
expression and opinion, including journalists
and opposition political party members,
remained in detention. These included some
convicted in unfair trials, some whose trials
continued, and some who continued to be
detained without charge.
Access to detention centres for monitoring
and documenting the treatment of detainees
continued to be severely restricted.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture took place in local police stations,
Maikelawi federal police station, federal and
regional prisons and military camps.
Torture methods reported included:
beating with sticks, rubber batons, gun
butts and other objects; burning; tying in
stress positions; electric shocks; and forced
prolonged physical exercise. Some detention
conditions amounted to torture, including
detaining people underground without
light, shackled and in prolonged solitary
confinement.
Torture typically took place in the early
stages of detention, in conjunction with the
interrogation of the detainee. Torture was
used to force detainees to confess, to sign
incriminating evidence and to incriminate
others. Those subjected to torture included
prisoners of conscience, who were arrested
for their perceived or actual expression
of dissent.
Defendants in several trials complained in
court that they were tortured or otherwise ill-
treated in detention. The courts failed to order
investigations into the complaints.
In several cases, prisoners of conscience
were denied access to adequate
medical care.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15OROMIA REGION
Ethnic Oromos continued to suffer many
violations of human rights in efforts to
suppress potential dissent in the region.
Large numbers of Oromo people continued
to be arrested or remained in detention
after arrests in previous years, based on
their peaceful expression of dissent, or
in numerous cases, based only on their
suspected opposition to the government.
Arrests were arbitrary, often made pre-
emptively and without evidence of a crime.
Many were detained without charge or trial,
and large numbers were detained in unofficial
places of detention, particularly in military
camps throughout the region. There was no
accountability for enforced disappearances
or extrajudicial executions during 2014 or in
previous years.
In the aftermath of the “Master Plan”
protests, increased levels of arrests of actual
or suspected dissenters continued. Large
numbers of arrests were reported, including
several hundred in early October in Hurumu
and Yayu Woredas districts in Illubabor
province, of high-school students, farmers
and other residents.
There were further reports of arrests
of students asking about the fate of their
classmates arrested during the “Master Plan”
protests, demanding their release and justice
for those killed, including 27 reported to
have been arrested in Wallega University in
late November.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Forcible returns
Ethiopian government agents were active in
many countries, some of which cooperated
with the Ethiopian authorities in forcibly
returning people wanted by the government.
In January, two representatives of the
rebel Ogaden National Liberation Front were
abducted and forcibly returned to Ethiopia
from Nairobi, Kenya. They were in Nairobi to
participate in further peace talks between the
group and the government.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
On 23 June, UK national Andargachew
Tsige, Secretary General of the outlawed
Ginbot 7 movement, was rendered from
Yemen to Ethiopia. On 8 July, a broadcast
was aired on state-run ETV showing Tsige
looking haggard and exhausted. By the
end of the year, he was still detained
incommunicado at an undisclosed location,
with no access to lawyers or family. The UK
government continued to be denied consular
access, except for two meetings with the
Ambassador, to one of which Andargachew
Tsige was brought hooded, and they were not
permitted to talk privately.
In March, former Gambella regional
governor Okello Akway, who has Norwegian
citizenship, was forcibly returned to Ethiopia
from South Sudan. In June, he was charged
with terrorism offences along with several
other people, in connection with Gambella
opposition movements in exile.
FIJI
Republic of Fiji
Head of state: Ratu Epeli Nailatikau
Head of government: Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama
Laws, policies and practices failed to
adequately protect human rights, placing
sweeping restrictions on freedoms of
expression, peaceful assembly and
association. Victims of serious human rights
violations, including torture and other ill-
treatment, were unable to seek redress in
the courts due to widespread immunities for
government officials and security forces.
BACKGROUND
In September Fiji held its first election
since the 2006 military coup. New electoral
laws expanded restrictions on freedom
of expression. A climate of fear and self-
censorship prevailed. Abuses by security
151forces continued to occur, including one
death in police custody in August.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION
Rights to freedoms of expression, peaceful
assembly and association were criminalized,
with people facing heavy fines and possible
imprisonment under a number of decrees.
The Electoral Decree 2014 prohibited civil
society organizations from ”campaigning”,
including providing human rights education,
on any issue relevant to elections. Breaching
this Decree carried a penalty of FJ$50,000
(approx. US$27,000) and up to 10 years’
imprisonment.
In August a human rights organization,
Citizens’ Constitutional Forum, was put
under criminal investigation for breaching
the Electoral Decree for organizing a series
of public lectures on democracy and
human rights.
In June the Media Industry Development
Authority called for a criminal investigation
against two university academics after they
had called on police to stop the harassment
and intimidation of journalists.
WORKERS’ RIGHTS
The Essential National Industries
(Employment) Decree 2011 continued
to violate key workers’ rights, including
by limiting collective bargaining rights,
curtailing the right to strike, banning overtime
payments, and voiding existing collective
agreements for workers in the sugar, aviation
and tourism industries. Under electoral laws,
trade union officials were not permitted to
hold office in a political party or to engage in
other political activities.
In January Daniel Urai, a trade union
leader, was arrested and charged with
participating in an unlawful strike, following
a strike at a hotel in Nadi. The charges were
dropped after two months.
152
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Extensive immunities under the Constitution
made it impossible to hold state perpetrators
accountable for serious human rights
violations such as torture and other ill-
treatment. Members of the military and
the police, as well as government officials,
operated with civil and criminal immunity
for violations of human rights. Many cases
of torture and other ill-treatment, including
several relating to recaptured prisoners,
remained unaddressed.
In August Vilikesa Soko, who had been
arrested on suspicion of robbery, died in
police custody. The autopsy report showed
that he suffered serious injuries consistent
with assault, leading to multiple organ failure.
While the new Police Commissioner promptly
ordered an investigation into the death and
suspended four police officers, no criminal
charges had been brought against the alleged
perpetrators at the end of the year.
FINLAND
Republic of Finland
Head of state: Sauli Niinistö
Head of government: Alexander Stubb (replaced
Jyrki Katainen in June)
Asylum-seekers and migrants faced
detention in unsuitable facilities. An
investigation into Finland’s involvement
in the US-led rendition programme failed
to find evidence. Support for victims of
sexual and gender-based violence remained
insufficient. Transgender people faced
obstacles to legal gender recognition.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Finland continued to detain asylum-seekers
and migrants, including children. During
2013, approximately 1,500 migrants were
detained under the Aliens Act, of whom
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the majority were held in police detention
facilities. Ten unaccompanied children were
held together with adults in the Metsälä
detention centre. In September 2014, a new
detention centre intended to hold families
with children and other vulnerable individuals,
connected with the Joutseno reception
facility, was opened.
In January, the Ombudsman for Minorities
began monitoring forced removals of refused
asylum-seekers and migrants. result of the most serious incident of violence
by their partner.
In March, the CEDAW Committee
recommended allocating adequate resources
to a National Action Plan to prevent violence
against women, establishing an institutional
mechanism to co-ordinate and monitor any
measures, ensuring sufficient and adequately
resourced shelters, opening rape crisis
centres and walk-in centres, and establishing
a 24-hour helpline.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY DISCRIMINATION –
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
In April, the Parliamentary Ombudsman
published the results of his investigation
into Finland’s alleged role in the US-led
programme of rendition and secret detention.
The Ombudsman found no evidence that
Finnish officials had any knowledge of
rendition flights by the CIA in Finland, but
“could not give any guarantees” as some
flight information was not included in the
probe because it was no longer available. 1
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Rape is still defined by the degree of violence
or threats of violence used by the perpetrator,
rather than the violation of sexual autonomy
and physical and mental integrity.
Support for victims of gender-based
and sexual violence remains insufficient
and at risk of deterioration. Two women’s
shelters were closed down in 2013, and
only two crisis centres offered support to
rape victims. Finland does not meet the
shelter requirements set by the Council
of Europe Istanbul Convention. Despite
the government’s stated intention to ratify
the Convention, its proposal published in
September included neither a dedicated
budget nor an action plan for extending the
required services to victims of violence.
A survey published in March by the
European Union Agency for Fundamental
Rights found that 47% of women had
experienced physical or sexual violence since
the age of 15 by a partner and/or non-partner.
Only 10% of women contacted the police as a
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Widespread prejudices and discriminatory
legislation negatively affected the enjoyment
of human rights by transgender individuals. 2
Transgender people can obtain legal gender
recognition only if they agree to be sterilized,
are diagnosed with a mental disorder, are
of age and can prove that they are single.
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health
finalized a draft law in November proposing
the removal of the requirements regarding
sterilization and single status; the bill had not
been presented to Parliament by the end of
the year.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
Conscientious objectors to military service
continued to be imprisoned for refusing to
undertake alternative civilian service, which
remained punitive and discriminatory in
length. Since February 2013, the duration of
alternative civilian service has been 347 days,
more than double the shortest military service
period of 165 days.

French Republic
Head of state: François Hollande
Head of government: Manuel Valls (replaced Jean-
Marc Ayrault in March)
Migrant Roma continued to be forcibly
evicted from informal settlements;
individuals and communities were often not
consulted or offered adequate alternative
accommodation. Concerns remained
about the impartiality and thoroughness
of investigations into allegations of ill-
treatment by the police. Same-sex couples
could enter into civil marriage following a
change in the law in 2013.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Officially, more than 19,000 people lived in
429 informal settlements at the beginning of
the year. Most of them were migrant Roma
from Romania, Bulgaria and the former
Yugoslavia. The French authorities continued
to forcibly evict them throughout the year.
According to the League of Human Rights
and the European Roma Rights Centre, more
than 11,000 individuals were forcibly evicted
in the first nine months of the year.
On 31 January, the Minister of Housing
announced a plan to provide long-term
housing solutions to the inhabitants of
informal settlements. On 28 February,
an agreement was signed between the
government and Adoma, a publicly
funded accommodation provider, and
some communities evicted from informal
settlements were offered alternative housing.
In spite of these developments, most of the
evicted individuals and families reportedly
did not receive any alternative housing. For
instance, on 18 June, some 400 individuals
were forcibly evicted from La Parette, the
largest informal settlement in Marseille. Only
18 families (150 people) were offered some
form of alternative accommodation.
154
On 21 October, more than 300 individuals
were forcibly evicted from the informal
settlement Les Coquetiers in Bobigny, a Paris
suburb, following an eviction order issued by
the municipality. According to the authorities,
134 individuals were offered some rehousing
solutions. More than 100 reportedly left the
settlement before the eviction took place as
they had not been offered any alternative
accommodation. About 60 individuals were
forcibly evicted and subsequently offered
short-term accommodation in Paris. 1
While the authorities did not collect official
data on hate crimes against Roma, civil
society organizations reported several violent
attacks against Roma. Concerns remained
that the authorities often did not take into
account any alleged discriminatory motive in
the investigation of these cases. The criminal
investigation against four police officers
who had injured a Roma man in November
2011, while carrying out a forced eviction in
Marseille, was still ongoing at the end of the
year. 2
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
On 18 May 2013, civil marriage was made
available to all couples irrespective of gender.
Adoption rights were extended to married
same-gender couples.
Despite repeated commitments by the
government to reform abusive practices,
transgender people continued to be subjected
to psychiatric diagnosis and unnecessary
medical treatments such as surgery and
sterilization in order to obtain legal recognition
of their gender. 3
DISCRIMINATION – MUSLIMS
Two judgments issued during the year failed
to uphold Muslim women’s right to freedoms
of expression, religion and belief, and non-
discrimination. On 25 June, the Court of
Cassation found that the management of
a private kindergarten did not discriminate
against a Muslim employee in 2008 when
she was dismissed for wearing a headscarf
Amnesty International Report 2014/15in the workplace. On 1 July, in the case of
SAS v. France, the European Court of Human
Rights found that the 2011 law prohibiting the
complete covering of the face in public did
not constitute a disproportionate restriction of
the right to freedom of religion. 4 opposition leader, to Russia, from where he
could be forcibly returned to Kazakhstan. At
the end of the year, an appeal was pending
before the Court of Cassation. If extradited, he
risked facing unfair trial in Russia and torture
or other ill-treatment in Kazakhstan. 5
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
In 2013, the Defender of Rights, an
independent public authority, dealt with
almost 1,000 allegations of acts of violence
perpetrated by police. However, concerns
remained about the impartiality and
thoroughness of investigations into these
allegations by judicial authorities.
In February 2014, the Court of Cassation
reopened the case of Ali Ziri, an Algerian man
who died in custody in 2009, which had been
dismissed in 2012. On 19 November, the
prosecuting authorities requested before the
Rennes Appeal Court that further investigation
be conducted into the case. However, on
12 December the Investigative Chamber
of the Rennes Appeal Court confirmed the
2012 dismissal.
On 23 September, Raymond Gurême, an
89-year-old French Traveller, suffered several
injuries allegedly as a result of excessive force
during a police operation at the site where he
lived. An investigation was ongoing at the end
of the year.
On 26 October, 21-year-old Rémi Fraisse
was fatally injured by an explosive anti-riot
grenade thrown by National Gendarmerie
officers during a demonstration against the
Sivens dam project in the Tarn region. About
20 other complaints of police ill-treatment
were reportedly filed by people protesting
against the project. On 2 December, an
internal investigation found that the National
Gendarmerie officers abided by the law.
Concerns remained about the impartiality and
thoroughness of this investigation. On 16 October 2013, President Hollande
announced that 500 Syrian refugees would
be resettled in France during 2014. Between
300 and 350 were resettled by the end of
the year. On 27 March, 85 Syrian nationals
were reportedly stopped by police on arrival at
Paris Gare de Lyon railway station. They were
not given the opportunity to claim asylum and
were given one month to leave France.
Also in March, a circular by the Minister
of the Interior concerning undocumented
migrants instructed authorities to deport
foreign nationals whose asylum claims had
been rejected by OFPRA, the French Office
for Refugees and Stateless People, through
the priority asylum procedure. While these
decisions could be appealed against before
the National Court of the Right to Asylum, the
appeal did not have the effect of suspending
the deportation. A bill aimed at reforming
asylum procedures was adopted by the
National Assembly and was pending before
the Senate.
On 10 July, the European Court of Human
Rights found that the refusal of French
authorities to issue visas for the purpose
of family reunification to the children of
two refugees and three migrants residing
in France violated the applicants’ right to
family life.
In October, more than 2,500 migrants and
asylum-seekers, mainly from Afghanistan,
Ethiopia, Eritrea and Syria, were living in
harsh conditions in the Calais region. Most
were attempting to reach the UK. In May, the
authorities forcibly evicted 700 migrants and
asylum-seekers from informal settlements
in the area following a reported outbreak of
scabies. 6 Discussions concerning the opening

On 14 March, Rwandan national and former
head of the Rwandan intelligence services
Pascal Simbikangwa, was sentenced
by the Paris Assize Court to 25 years’
imprisonment for genocide and complicity
in crimes against humanity perpetrated in
the context of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
This was the first case to come to trial on
the basis of extraterritorial jurisdiction since
the establishment in 2012 of a specialized
investigative unit tasked to deal with cases
concerning genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity. At the end of the year, the
unit was investigating more than 30 alleged
crimes perpetrated abroad.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Several demonstrations concerning
the situation in Gaza, including two
demonstrations scheduled to take place in
Paris on 19 and 26 July, were prohibited
on grounds of security. The demonstrations
took place despite the ban. Although some
incidents of violence occurred, concerns
remained as to whether the decisions to ban
them were necessary and proportionate.

Republic of the Gambia
Head of state and government: Yahya Jammeh
2014 marked 20 years since President
Yahya Jammeh came to power. 1 The
authorities continued to repress dissent.
The government continued its policy of
non-co-operation with UN human rights
mechanisms. Successive legislation
was passed further restricting freedom
of expression and increasing punitive
measures against journalists. Human
rights defenders and journalists continued
to face imprisonment and harassment.
The rights of lesbian, gay bisexual,
transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people
were further threatened. The year ended
with an attempted coup on 30 December,
leading to dozens of arrests and widespread
crackdowns on media outlets.

BACKGROUND
Gambia’s human rights record was assessed
under the UN Universal Periodic Review
(UPR) in October. 2 Concerns by UN member
states included Gambia’s restrictions on the
right to freedom of expression, its renewed
use of the death penalty, and discrimination
and attacks on people on the basis of their
sexual orientation and gender identity.
During their visit to Gambia in November,
the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,
summary or arbitrary executions and the
Special Rapporteur on torture were denied
Amnesty International Report 2014/15access to detention centres where prisoners
were believed to be at risk of torture. They
described torture as a “consistent practice”
in Gambia and expressed concerns about
the 2012 executions and the climate of
impunity. 3 In August, the authorities had
unilaterally postponed the visit of the Special
Rapporteurs, without adequate explanation.
In January 2013, President Jammeh
suspended political dialogue with the EU
following the inclusion of human rights on
the agenda. Although discussions resumed
in July 2013, little progress was made on
implementing human rights commitments.
In October 2013, President Jammeh
announced Gambia’s withdrawal from the
Commonwealth, which was collaborating with
the Gambian authorities on capacity-building
initiatives for the judiciary and establishing a
national human rights commission.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Successive legislation was passed in
recent years restricting the right to freedom
of expression.
In August 2014, the National Assembly
passed the Criminal Code (Amendment)
Act that introduced the charge “absconding
state officials”. This could be used to target
individuals who expressed dissent and chose
to remain outside the country.
In July 2013, the National Assembly
passed the Information and Communication
(Amendment) Act, allowing for penalties of
up to 15 years’ imprisonment and hefty fines
for offences including: criticizing government
officials online; spreading “false news” about
the government or public officials; making
derogatory statements against public officials;
and inciting dissatisfaction or instigating
violence against the government.
In May 2013, the National Assembly
passed the Criminal Code (Amendment)
Act, broadening the definition of various
offences and imposing harsher punishments
for acts of public disorder, such as “hurling
abusive insults” or “singing abusive songs”,
and for giving false information to a public
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
servant. For example, the Act increased the
punishment for providing false information to
a public servant from six months’ to five years’
imprisonment and/or a larger fine.
Journalists
Journalists faced harassment, intimidation,
arbitrary arrest and detention for carrying out
their legitimate work. 4
Sanna Camara was arrested on 27 June
and charged with publishing false information
after writing an article on human trafficking in
Gambia for the Standard newspaper. He was
denied access to a lawyer or his relatives. He
was released on bail the next day and ordered
to report to the police headquarters several
times per week over several months.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders faced harassment,
intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention,
torture and enforced disappearance. There
were risks of reprisals against Gambians
who sought to engage in relation to the UPR
examination on Gambia and ahead of the visit
of the UN Special Rapporteurs.
By the end of the year no investigation had
been instigated into the unlawful arrest and
torture of Imam Baba Leigh, a prominent
human rights defender and Muslim cleric. He
had been arrested by National Intelligence
Agency (NIA) officers in December 2012 and
placed in incommunicado detention. He was
repeatedly tortured for publicly condemning
the government’s use of the death penalty.
He was released following a presidential
pardon in May 2013 and subsequently left
the country in fear for his safety.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Detainees were routinely tortured by law
enforcement personnel as punishment and in
order to force “confessions”.
Abdou Jeli Keita, an officer with the
National Drug Enforcement Agency and
a former journalist, was pushed into a car
outside his home in Wellingara on 1 August
by five men wearing civilian clothes, believed
to be members of the security services. He
157was blindfolded and driven to an undisclosed
location where he said he was detained and
beaten. Abdou Jeli Keita was not charged, nor
allowed access to a lawyer or his relatives. He
was told by his captors that he was detained
because he was suspected of publicizing
information on poor prison conditions. He was
released the following day.
On 18 December 2013, Amadou Sanneh,
national treasurer of the opposition United
Democratic Party (UDP), and two other
UDP members, Alhagie Sambou Fatty and
Malang Fatty, were convicted of sedition and
sentenced to up to five years’ imprisonment.
They were held incommunicado at the NIA
headquarters for nearly a month prior to
their trial in October 2013. All three alleged
they were tortured to confess on national
television. Alhagie Sambou Fatty and Malang
Fatty had no legal representation throughout
their detention and trial. The three men are
prisoners of conscience.
DEATH PENALTY
In November, the Supreme Court commuted
the death sentences of Lang Tombong Tamba
and six others to life imprisonment. The seven
men – Chief of Defence Staff Lieutenant
General Lang Tombong Tamba, Brigadier
General Omar Bun Mbye, Major Lamin Bo
Badgie, Lieutenant Colonel Kawsu Camara,
former Deputy Inspector General of Police
Momodou B. Gaye, Gibril Ngorr Secka and
Abdoulie Joof – were convicted of treason
and sentenced to death in 2010. They had
been sentenced to death for treason, contrary
to the Constitution which permits the death
penalty only for crimes “resulting in the death
of another person”.
In a media interview in August 2013,
President Jammeh justified the retention of
the death penalty as being “divine law” and
stated that he would not pardon anybody
condemned to death. This would deny
defendants’ right under international law to
seek clemency.
158
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
At least eight people, including three women
and a 17-year-old youth, were arrested by
men identifying themselves as agents of the
NIA and Presidential Guards between 7 and
13 November and threatened with torture
because of their presumed sexual orientation.
They were told that if they did not “confess”
their homosexuality, including by providing
the names of others, a device would be forced
into their anus or vagina to “test” their sexual
orientation. Such treatment would violate
international law prohibiting torture and
other ill-treatment. A further six women were
reportedly arrested on 18 and 19 November
on the same grounds. 5
In August, the National Assembly passed
the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act 2014
which created the crime of “aggravated
homosexuality”, carrying a life sentence.
The wording of the Amendment was vague,
making it open to wide-ranging abuse by
the authorities. Among those who could be
charged with “aggravated homosexuality”
were “repeat offenders” and people living
with HIV who were suspected of being gay or
lesbian. 6
In a speech on national television in
February, President Jammeh attacked LGBTI
rights, stating, “We will fight these vermin
called homosexuals or gays the same way we
are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes – if
not more aggressively.” In May, President
Jammeh threatened Gambians seeking
asylum as a result of discrimination on the
basis of their sexual orientation.
IMPUNITY
The government made no progress towards
implementing the judgments of the
ECOWAS Court of Justice in the enforced
disappearance of journalist Ebrima Manneh,
the torture of journalist Musa Saidykhan and
the unlawful killing of Deyda Hydara. 7

GEORGIA
Georgia
Head of state: Giorgi Margvelashvili
Head of government: Irakli Garibashvili
Religious and sexual minorities continued
to face discrimination and violence
and in several instances were unable
to exercise their right to freedom of
assembly. Opposition politicians were
subject to violent attacks. Allegations of
ill-treatment by police and penitentiary
officials continued to be reported and
were often inadequately investigated.
Domestic violence against women
remained widespread.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
On 27 June, the European Union signed the
Association Agreement with Georgia.
Allegations of the selective prosecution of
figures associated with the opposition party
United National Movement (UNM) persisted.
On 13 August, the Chief Prosecutor's Office
charged former President Mikheil Saakashvili
in his absence with embezzlement and
abuse of office. On 9 December, the OSCE
trial monitoring, which focused on criminal
cases against senior officials in President
Saakashvili’s government, identified concerns
related to a number of fair trial rights,
including equality of arms between parties
and the presumption of innocence.
Defence minister Irakli Alasania was
sacked on 4 November following the arrests
of five senior defence officials on 28 October,
which he had dismissed as politically
motivated. The officials were accused of
misspending GEL 4.1 million (US$2.1 million)
in what the prosecution claimed was a sham
tender. Several ministerial resignations
followed resulting in the breakdown of the
parliamentary coalition.
In November, three detainees from the US
detention facility at Guantánamo Bay were
transferred to Georgia for resettlement.
On 24 November, the de facto authorities
in Georgia’s Abkhazia region signed the
Agreement on Alliance and Strategic
Partnership with the Russian Federation
making the breakaway territory even more
dependent on Russia in defence, external
relations and economic matters.
DISCRIMINATION
On 2 May, an anti-discrimination law was
adopted but without provisions which had
been included in an earlier draft. These
would have introduced an independent
oversight mechanism and financial penalties
for violations.
Reported incidents of violent religious
intolerance increased. The authorities failed
to protect the rights of religious minorities,
159address recurring violence and effectively
investigate attacks.
On 1 June, local Orthodox Christians in the
town of Terjola, western Georgia, gathered
to protest against the construction of a place
of worship for Jehovah’s Witnesses. They
threatened to use physical violence and
destroy property. Several Jehovah’s Witnesses
reported being harassed and intimidated by
local residents, including receiving death
threats and having stones thrown at their
houses. Police issued written warnings to the
alleged offenders but did not conduct any
formal investigation.
In September, residents of the town
of Kobuleti, western Georgia, repeatedly
blocked an entry to the local Muslim boarding
school and physically prevented staff and
schoolchildren from entering the building.
On the first day of the new school year, a pig
was slaughtered at the building entrance and
its head was nailed to the door. A criminal
investigation was opened.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
On 22 October, clashes between the police
and the local Muslim community broke out in
the village of Mokhe, western Georgia, after
the local authorities began to construct a
library on the site of a derelict building which,
the Muslim community claimed, was once a
mosque. Police reportedly insulted and used
disproportionate force against protesters,
arresting 14. Several detainees were
reportedly beaten, among them a woman who
received serious injuries to her face. Three
detainees were released the next day without
charges while the others were fined 250 lari
(US$140) each by the court in the town of
Akhaltsikhe.
In May, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and intersex activists abandoned plans
to organize a public action to mark the
International Day Against Homophobia and
Transphobia (IDAHO) due to the lack of
security guarantees by the authorities. In
2013, the IDAHO street event was thwarted
by a violent attack by thousands of counter-
160
demonstrators while the police failed to
ensure people’s safety.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
A number of violent attacks against opposition
politicians were reported in which the police
failed to prevent violence.
On 9 June, Gigi Ugulava and Giga Bokeria,
leaders of the opposition party United
National Movement (UNM), were assaulted
by members of the Georgian Dream Coalition
(GDC) during a pre-election meeting with
voters in the town of Tsageri. According to
eyewitnesses, police officers standing nearby
did not intervene to stop the violence.
On 30 September, the office of the NGO
Free Zone, which was associated with the
UNM, was attacked by about 50 people.
Several staff members were injured as the
police failed to arrive promptly despite the
warnings of possible violence.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
There were several reports of torture and
other ill-treatment of detainees in prison and
in police custody. Official investigations were
often slow and ineffective. Of the 18 cases of
alleged ill-treatment in prison documented
by the Public Defender (Ombudsman), in
just one case an investigation was opened for
charges of ill-treatment. No prosecutions were
reported at the end of the year.
On 15 March, Irakli Kelbakiani reported
being forced into a police car, beaten with
hands and iron bats on his head, face and
body, and asphyxiated by police officers.
According to the initial incident report, bruises
and other injuries were evident on his arrival
at the police station.
Amiran Dzebisashvili reported that on 31
October he was forced inside a police car and
threatened after he had testified in court that
Vasil Lomsadze was beaten by police officers
during his arrest on 27 October 2013. Vasil
Lomsadze was standing trial for resisting
arrest and allegedly attacking police officers
during this incident. There had been no
effective investigation into Vasil Lomsadze’s
Amnesty International Report 2014/15allegations of being beaten by police at the
end of the year, despite several eyewitness
accounts and his recorded injuries.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
At least 25 women and girls were reported
to have been killed as a result of domestic
violence. In several cases the victims had
previously asked police for protection but had
not received adequate support.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
The legislative amendments of 28 November
allowed security agencies to retain direct
access to communications surveillance
amidst concerns that such an access can
be misused by the agencies to bypass the
judicial oversight for surveillance.
GERMANY
Federal Republic of Germany
Head of state: Joachim Gauck
Head of government: Angela Merkel
Humanitarian admission programmes for
20,000 Syrian refugees were approved.
There were no improvements in the
investigation of serious human rights
violations by police. The National Agency for
the Prevention of Torture remained under-
resourced. Discriminatory attacks against
asylum-seekers and minorities continued
and concerns regarding the investigation
and prosecution of these crimes remained.
Human rights criteria for arms exports were
implemented.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Between 2013 and 2014, Germany started
three humanitarian admission programmes
for 20,000 Syrian refugees from Syria’s
neighbouring countries and Egypt. The main
aim was extended family reunification. Three
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
hundred refugees were offered resettlement
through a UNHCR programme. In December,
Germany also decided to offer resettlement
to 500 refugees per year starting in 2015. In
September, Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia
and Herzegovina were legally defined as
safe countries of origin, which reduced
opportunities for nationals of these countries
to seek protection. A law was passed allowing
asylum-seekers to move freely within the
country after three months of residence and
to have unhindered access to the job market
after 15 months. The amended Asylum
Seekers Benefit Act, due to enter into force
in April 2015, fell short of human rights
standards particularly regarding health care.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The authorities failed to address obstacles
in the effective investigation of allegations of
ill-treatment by police. None of the federal
states established an independent complaints
mechanism to investigate allegations of
serious human rights violations by the
police. Except for the federal states of Berlin,
Brandenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate and
Schleswig-Holstein, there was no obligation
for police officers to wear identity badges.
The National Agency for the Prevention of
Torture, Germany’s preventive mechanism
under the Optional Protocol to the UN
Convention against Torture, remained severely
under-resourced, even though there was an
increase of funds and a doubling of members
for the Joint Commission of the Federal
States, one of the two constituent bodies
of the Agency. Contrary to international
standards, the appointment procedure of
the National Agency’s members lacked
independence and transparency and
excluded civil society.
Investigations and proceedings for
excessive use of force by the Stuttgart Police
in relation to the disproportionate use of water
cannons during demonstrations in the city in
September 2010 continued.
In September, the Federal Court of Justice
upheld the December 2012 conviction of
161a police officer by the Magdeburg Regional
Court, which convicted the officer for
negligent homicide in connection with the
death of Oury Jalloh, who died in a fire in
a cell in a Dessau police station in 2005.
The circumstances of Oury Jalloh’s death
remained unclear.
Also in September, media reports exposed
the repeated ill-treatment of asylum-seekers
by private security personnel in three
reception facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia.
DISCRIMINATION
In August 2013, the ad-hoc federal
Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry published
ground-breaking conclusions regarding the
authorities’ failure to investigate a series of
murders targeting minorities perpetrated
by the far-right group National Socialist
Underground (NSU). In particular, the
authorities had failed to co-operate and to
investigate the racist motive of the murders.
The Committee recommended reforming
the Criminal Code and the system used by
police to collect data on “politically motivated
crimes”, which included information on
hate crimes.
In August 2014, the government proposed
amending Section 46 of the Criminal Code
to require courts to take into account racist,
xenophobic or any other “degrading” motive
when deciding sentences. The proposal was
pending before Parliament at the end of
the year.
In the first half of 2014, according to civil
society data, there were 155 protests against
the establishment of reception facilities for
asylum-seekers, mostly by far-right groups.
Eighteen attacks against asylum-seekers were
also reported.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
The 1980 Law on Changing First Names
and the Establishment of Sex Status
in Special Cases remained in force,
requiring transgender people to comply
with mandatory criteria to legally change
162
their gender and names. These included
obtaining a psychiatric diagnosis and an
expert assessment ordered by courts. These
requirements violated transgender people’s
rights to private life and to the highest
attainable standard of health. 1
ARMS TRADE
In anticipation of more stringent EU
regulations on surveillance technologies,
the Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy
ordered stricter controls on exports of
surveillance technologies to countries which
commit human rights violations. Germany
ratified the UN Arms Trade Treaty in April
and started implementing articles 6 and 7 on
human rights criteria for arms exports and
transfers before its entry into force, due on
24 December. However, data on arms exports
licensed in 2014, including small arms
components for Saudi Arabia, raised concern.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
In November, the Foreign Office, in
co-operation with other ministries, business
representatives and civil society groups, took
steps towards the introduction of a national
action plan on business and human rights to
implement relevant UN guiding principles.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
The first trial based on the 2002 Code of
Crimes under International Law against
Rwandan citizens Ignace Murwanashyaka
and Straton Musoni continued at Stuttgart
Higher Regional Court.
On 18 February, the Frankfurt Higher
Regional Court found Rwandan citizen
Onesphore Rwabukombe guilty of abetting
genocide. In this first German judgement
regarding the Rwandan genocide of the Tutsi
minority in 1994, Onesphore Rwabukombe
was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment for
aiding the commission of a massacre at the
Kiziguro church compound.

GHANA
Republic of Ghana
Head of state and government: John Dramani
Mahama
Ghana continued to hand down
death sentences although an ongoing
constitutional review process could lead to
abolition. Domestic violence against women
remained widespread.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts continued to hand down death
sentences. No executions have taken place
since 1993.
In March the Constitutional Review
Implementation Committee submitted a draft
bill to the Attorney General and Minister of
Justice to amend provisions of the 1992
Constitution; these included a proposal
to abolish the death penalty. The bill was
expected to be referred back to Parliament for
approval before a referendum is conducted.
In March, in the case of Dexter Eddie
Johnson v. Ghana, the UN Human Rights
Committee condemned the use of automatic
and mandatory death sentences in Ghana. It
called on the government to provide Dexter
Eddie Johnson with an effective remedy,
including the commutation of his death
sentence, and to adjust its legislation to
avoid similar violations in the future. The
government had not responded by the end of
the year.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Violence against women and girls remained
widespread. A total of 16,275 cases were
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
reported to the police-run Domestic Violence
Support Unit in 2013. Although the law
prohibits domestic violence, victims were not
provided with adequate protection and legal
assistance to lodge complaints with the Unit.
GREECE
Hellenic Republic
Head of state: Karolos Papoulias
Head of government: Antonis Samaras
Allegations of excessive use of force and
ill-treatment by law enforcement officers
persisted and continued to be inadequately
investigated. Detention conditions
remained very poor. The maximum length
of administrative detention of irregular
migrants was extended beyond 18 months.
Unlawful push-backs of migrants across the
Greece-Turkey border continued. New hate
crime legislation was adopted in September
amid growing concern at the levels of
racist violence.
BACKGROUND
In October the Public Prosecutor proposed
the indictment of 67 members and leaders
of Golden Dawn, a far right-wing party,
for forming, directing or participating in a
criminal organization. Fifty-seven individuals,
including six MPs, were accused of a series of
additional offences, including the murder in
September 2013 of anti-fascist singer Pavlos
Fyssas, causing “unprovoked bodily harm
to migrants” and the unlawful possession
of weapons.
In November, anarchist Nikos Romanos,
detained at Korydallos prison near the capital,
Athens, began a prolonged hunger strike in
protest at the refusal of the authorities to allow
him educational leave to attend a university
course. He had been imprisoned in October
after being convicted along with three other
163men of armed robbery. In February 2013,
Nikos Romanos and two of the other men
reported that they were tortured while in
detention following their arrest in the northern
town of Veroia. On 10 December, Nikos
Romanos ended his hunger strike after a
legislative amendment was passed allowing
prisoners to attend campus courses while
wearing electronic tags.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Strengthened border controls and greater
co-operation with Turkish border guards
contributed to a sharp decline in the number
of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers
entering Greece across its land borders. As
a result, the number attempting to reach
Greece by sea increased markedly in the
first eight months of the year. By the end
of the year more than 103 refugees and
migrants, including many children, drowned
or were unaccounted for while attempting the
crossing. 1
There were documented cases of frequent
unlawful push-backs of irregular migrants
across the Greece-Turkey border.
On 20 January, three women and eight
children died when a fishing boat carrying 27
refugees sank near the island of Farmakonisi.
Survivors said that the boat sank as Greek
coastguards were towing their vessel towards
Turkey during a push-back operation. The
survivors also reported that they were stripped
and beaten after they arrived at Farmakonisi.
The authorities denied that any push-back or
ill-treatment had taken place. In August, the
Prosecutors of the Pireus Naval Court closed
the case following a preliminary investigation.
National NGOs continued to document
very poor detention conditions in areas where
migrants and asylum-seekers were held
for immigration purposes. Detainees faced
considerable obstacles in applying for asylum.
In March, the Minister of Public Order
authorized the detention of irregular migrants
pending deportation beyond the 18 months
period allowed under EU law.
164
In September, the National Commission
on Human Rights criticized the Ministry
of Public Order and Citizen Protection for
compromising the independence of the
Asylum Appeals Board by failing to appoint
any of the candidates it had proposed.
Reception conditions for refugees remained
of serious concern. At the end of November,
between 200 and 250 Syrian refugees,
including many women and children, started
a protest and subsequently a hunger strike at
the Parliament square in Athens requesting
the authorities to provide them with shelter
and travel documents.
In July, a court in Patras found two
foremen guilty of causing serious bodily harm
by shooting at Bangladeshi migrant workers
on a strawberry farm in Nea Manolada, in
April 2013, following a dispute over pay
and working conditions. The owner of the
farm and another foreman were acquitted.
At the end of October, the Supreme Court
Prosecutor rejected a request made by two
NGOs, the Hellenic League for Human Rights
and the Greek Council for Refugees, to annul
the verdict because of procedural flaws
during the investigation and trial.
DISCRIMINATION
Hate crimes
Between October 2011 and January 2014,
the Racist Violence Recording Network
recorded more than 350 incidents of racist
violence. The Network noted a decrease in
organized racist attacks against migrants and
an increase in hate crimes against lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex
people in 2014. Between January and June,
the Police Departments and Offices tackling
racist violence recorded 31 incidents with a
possible racist motive.
The response of the criminal justice
system to hate crimes remained inadequate.
Investigators continued to fail to investigate
possible hate motives, prosecutors failed
to present such evidence in court, and
judges failed to consider racist or other hate
Amnesty International Report 2014/15motives an aggravating circumstance when
sentencing offenders.
In a unanimous ruling in April, a court in
Athens sentenced two Greek nationals to
life imprisonment after convicting them of
stabbing to death S. Luqman, a Pakistani
national, in January 2013. Despite the trial
prosecutor underlining the racist motive
behind the attack, the court did not take it
into account as an aggravating circumstance
during sentencing.
A Joint Ministerial Decision, adopted
in June, provided for the suspension of
administrative detention and deportation
orders issued against victims and witnesses of
hate crimes. It also granted special residence
permits to cover the time required for the
prosecution and conviction of perpetrators.
In September, amendments to hate crime
legislation were adopted that increased
penalties for committing and inciting racist
violence, criminalized Holocaust denial and
included sexual orientation, gender identity
and disability among the prohibited grounds
for discrimination. A proposal that would
have legally recognized same-sex unions
was rejected.
Roma
Roma families continued to face forced
evictions. Many Roma children were
excluded from or segregated in education.
Discriminatory police raids on Roma
settlements continued.
By the end of the year, 74 Roma families
living in a settlement in Halandri, Athens,
continued to be at risk of forced eviction.
Initial plans to evict the families in February
were postponed following an injunction by the
UN Human Rights Committee. In September,
the Halandri municipal authorities sought
to demolish 12 homes despite a renewal
of the injunction. Following protests by the
Roma residents, only five homes, which at
the time were uninhabited, were demolished.
The Decentralized Administration of Attika
committed to finding an adequate alternative
location to resettle the families.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In November, a court in the town of
Messolonghi sentenced three men to eight
months’ imprisonment with suspension for
causing serious bodily harm to Paraskevi
Kokoni, a Romani woman, and her nephew
in October 2012. It was not clear whether the
court took the hate motive into account during
sentencing. 2
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In October, the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture issued its report on
its 2013 visit to Greece. It highlighted the
large number of allegations of ill-treatment
of people detained in police and border
guard stations by law enforcement officials
and a number of allegations of verbal abuse,
including of a racist nature. The report
criticized overcrowding, unhygienic conditions
and inadequate health care in Greek prisons.
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
against prisoners, migrants and refugees
continued. In March, guards at Nigrita prison
in northern Greece reportedly tortured to
death Ilia Kareli, an inmate of Albanian
nationality. In October, 13 prison guards
were charged with “aggravated torture that
caused death”.
Police used excessive force and misused
chemical irritants against protesters and
journalists on several occasions throughout
the year. A large number of the reported
abuses took place during two student
protests, one against a university lock-out
on 13 November, and another during a
protest for the anniversary of the 1973
students’ uprising on 17 November. Sporadic
convictions of offending law enforcement
officers failed to dent the longstanding culture
of impunity for police abuses. 3
Despite legislative changes introduced in
March extending the mandate of the Office for
Incidents of Arbitrary Conduct to cover racist
incidents and allowing for the Ombudsman to
attend hearings, concerns remained over its
effectiveness and independence.
165CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
The arrests and convictions of conscientious
objectors continued during the year. At least
four conscientious objectors were convicted
for insubordination and received suspended
prison sentences. Six individuals refusing
to serve both the military and the punitive
alternative service were also arrested and
detained for short periods.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In January, an Athens court convicted a
blogger of “religious insult”. His 10-month
prison sentence was suspended on appeal.
The blogger had set up a Facebook page on
which he satirized an orthodox monk who
had died.

GUATEMALA
Republic of Guatemala
Head of state and government: Otto Pérez Molina
Impunity continued for genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity carried out
during the internal armed conflict between
1960 and 1996. Violence against women
and girls remained a concern. People
protesting over hydroelectric and mining
projects were subject to forced evictions and
excessive use of force by the security forces.
Guatemala retained the death penalty in law
for ordinary crimes. However, no prisoners
166
were on death row and no death sentences
were handed down during the year.
BACKGROUND
Street gangs and drug trafficking cartels
contributed to a precarious public security
situation. The authorities reported over 5,000
homicides committed during the year.
In June, the former National Director of
Police, Erwin Sperisen, was convicted in
Switzerland for his role in the extrajudicial
execution of seven unarmed prisoners during
a police operation in the El Pavón prison
in 2006.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Local human rights organizations reported
over 500 killings of women during the year.
In May the Inter-American Court of Human
Rights ruled against Guatemala in the case
of María Isabel Franco, who was sexually
assaulted, tortured and murdered in 2001,
at the age of 15. The Court concluded that
Guatemala had acted in a discriminatory
manner due to María Isabel’s gender, and
that in the context of pervasive violence
against women, the authorities had not acted
promptly when María Isabel’s mother alerted
the police of her daughter’s disappearance.
IMPUNITY
The right to truth, justice and reparation for
victims of crimes against humanity during
the internal armed conflict (1960 to 1996)
remained a concern. Former President Efraín
Ríos Montt was convicted in May 2013 of
committing genocide and crimes against
humanity against members of Maya-Ixil
Indigenous community during his presidency.
The Constitutional Court overturned his
conviction 10 days later on a technicality. He
had yet to be retried by the end of 2014.
In February, the Attorney General’s term
was cut short by the Constitutional Court.
There were concerns that her removal was
the result of her role in ensuring that former
President Ríos Montt was brought to trial, and
her commitment to investigate human rights
Amnesty International Report 2014/15violations that occurred during the internal
armed conflict.
In May, Congress passed a non-binding
resolution stating that genocide had not
occurred during the internal armed conflict.
The resolution directly contradicted a
1999 UN investigation which concluded
that genocide, war crimes and crimes
against humanity had occurred during the
internal armed conflict, in which 200,000
people were killed and 45,000 people were
forcibly disappeared. Over 80% of those
killed and disappeared were of Indigenous
Maya ethnicity.
In July, Fermín Solano Barrillas, a former
member of the armed opposition during the
internal armed conflict, was sentenced to 90
years in prison for directing the massacre
of 22 people in 1988, in El Aguacate,
Chimaltenango department.
LAND DISPUTES
Fearing impacts on their livelihoods,
communities continued to oppose existing
and proposed hydroelectric and mining
projects, and protested against the lack of
consultation around these projects.
In May 2013, in response to this
opposition, the government proposed
a moratorium on the issuing of new
mining licences. Yet concerns remained
that the proposed legislation to approve
mining licences fell short of international
standards and did not address Indigenous
and rural communities’ concerns around
lack of consultation and free, prior and
informed consent.
In May, local activists occupying a mining
site in San José del Golfo, Guatemala
department, were forcibly removed by the
police. The Office of UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights expressed concern at the
use of excessive force by the security forces
during their removal.
In June, local communities protested
against the proposed construction of the
Xalalá hydroelectric dam in Alta Verapaz and
Quiché departments. In August, three people
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
from the community of Monte Olivo, Alta
Verapaz department were killed. They were
reportedly shot by police officers during the
forced eviction of a community opposed to
the construction of a hydroelectric project in
the area. By the end of the year nobody had
been held to account for their deaths.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Attacks, threats and intimidation against
human rights defenders and journalists
continued during the year.
In August, Gustavo Illescas, a journalist
with the Independent Media Centre in
Guatemala, was threatened after he reported
on police violence during the forced eviction
in Monte Olivo (see above). A colleague was
detained by masked men and told to convey
a threatening message to Gustavo Illescas.
The colleague was also beaten and sexually
assaulted. By the end of the year nobody had
been held to account for his ill-treatment or
for the threats against Gustavo Illescas.
GUINEA
Republic of Guinea
Head of state: Alpha Condé
Head of government: Mohamed Said Fofana
One of the largest Ebola Virus Disease
outbreaks since the virus was discovered
in 1976 hit the country; many essential
provisions remained lacking. Security forces
regularly used excessive force against
civilians. Journalists were subjected to
intimidation. Concerns about poor and
inhumane conditions of detention, and
torture and other ill-treatment of detainees,
were highlighted by the UN Committee
against Torture and the UN Office of the
High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR). At the end of the year, a
preliminary examination by the Prosecutor
167of the International Criminal Court (ICC)
remained open from 2009.
BACKGROUND
One of the worst Ebola outbreaks emerged
in Guinea, quickly spreading to neighbouring
countries. By the end of the year, more than
1,700 people had died, including at least 70
health workers.
Legislative elections took place in
September 2013 after repeated delays.
Violence between members of opposing
political parties erupted both before and
after the elections. International observers
reported voting irregularities. The Supreme
Court validated the results nearly two months
later, resulting in protests and allegations of
fraud. Prime Minister Fofana was reappointed
in January 2014 and a new government was
installed. The National Assembly convened
for the first time in 2014 under President
Kory Kondiano.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
The UN Committee against Torture and the
OHCHR reviewed Guinea’s human rights
record. The OHCHR reported that detainees
and prisoners were held in squalid and
overcrowded facilities that fell far short of
international standards. In some cases
minors were detained with adults and there
were no prisons specifically for women.
The OHCHR also documented 11 cases of
death in detention due to lack of medical
care. The Committee raised concerns
about recent cases of torture, as well as
detention conditions, confessions extracted
under torture, and impunity for perpetrators
of torture.
demonstration of women with tear gas, batons
and gunshots. The women were protesting
against the hiring policy of a palm oil and
rubber production company.
Four people were reportedly shot dead
in March during a demonstration in Diécké.
They included a student, Mathieu Maomy. No
investigation had been opened by the end of
the year.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment were
widespread in detention centres throughout
2013 and 2014, resulting in at least one
death in custody. Security forces continued to
act with impunity.
The UN Committee against Torture
recommended in its Concluding Observations
that Guinea should conduct thorough,
independent and impartial investigations
without delay into all allegations of torture
and ill-treatment. In addition the Committee
urged Guinea to eliminate the practice
of female genital mutilation. The OHCHR
documented cases of torture in the regions
of Haute Guinée and Guinée Forestière,
and urged the government to adopt a law
prohibiting torture and to investigate torture in
detention facilities.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
In February, Tafsir Sylla died in hospital from
his injuries after being beaten by police while
resisting arrest in Fria. He had been arrested
along with three others for consuming Indian
hemp. The following day, hundreds of people
protested by attacking the police station, the
mayor’s office and the local prison, resulting
in the escape of at least 20 prisoners.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Security forces (police and the gendarmerie)
continued to use excessive force against
civilians in the capital, Conakry, and other
towns, as well as in the southeastern forest
region of Guinée Forestière.
In March, security forces in Guinée
Forestière dispersed a peaceful There were continued restrictions on press
freedom and journalists were targeted.
In September, police in Guinée Forestière
confiscated the cameras of journalists
and human rights defenders who were
investigating the killings of eight men who had
been attacked by the local population during
168
Amnesty International Report 2014/15an Ebola awareness campaign. The cameras
were returned the following day with all the
material deleted.
IMPUNITY
Investigations continued into the massacre
in the Grand Stade de Conakry on 28
September 2009, when security forces killed
more than 100 peaceful demonstrators and
injured at least 1,500 others. Dozens of
women were raped and others disappeared.
Moussa Dadis Camara, then head of the
military junta, was questioned in Burkina
Faso in July.
No progress was made towards bringing to
trial gendarmes and police officers suspected
of criminal responsibility for torturing
detainees in 2011 and 2012. Between 2011
and the end of 2014, in Conakry and Fria,
only seven officers were summoned to court
by an investigating judge. They all failed to
appear at their hearing, despite the legal
obligation to do so.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Since 2009 Guinea has remained under
preliminary investigation by the Prosecutor
of the ICC for crimes committed on 28
September 2009 and in the aftermath of
the massacre. The Office of the Prosecutor
concluded that there were reasonable
grounds to believe that these amounted
to crimes against humanity, including
murder, torture, rape and other forms of
sexual violence, persecution and enforced
disappearances. A delegation from the
Office of the Prosecutor visited Guinea in
February 2014 and noted that investigations
had advanced, but not sufficiently. In
June, Sékouba Konaté, then Minister of
Defence, submitted a list of suspects to the
ICC Prosecutor.
RIGHT TO HEALTH – EBOLA OUTBREAK
Delayed responses by the government and
the international community reportedly
contributed to the rapid spread of the
epidemic. Although Ebola response
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
committees were eventually organized
to co-ordinate provision of care and
communication, many essential resources
remained lacking.
In September, during an awareness-
raising campaign by humanitarian workers in
Womey, N’Zérékoré region, eight members
of the delegation, including health workers,
a journalist and members of a local radio
station, were killed by villagers who suspected
them of carrying the virus. Also in September,
two members of the Guinean Red Cross were
forced to flee the town of Forécariah when
people threw rocks at their vehicle after the
corpse of a woman which the health workers
were carrying fell from a body bag.
GUINEA-BISSAU
Republic of Guinea-Bissau
Head of state: José Mário Vaz (replaced Manuel
Serifo Nhamadjo in June)
Head of government: Domingos Simões Pereira
(replaced Rui Duarte de Barros in July)
Persistent political tensions and human
rights violations eased following elections
in April and the setting up of a new
government in July. Impunity for past
human rights violations, including political
killings in 2009, persisted. Social tension
decreased following the resumption of
international aid and the payment of arrears
on some public sector salaries.
BACKGROUND
After several postponements, parliamentary
and presidential elections were finally held in
April. The African Party for the Independence
of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC)
won the parliamentary election. Presidential
elections were won by José Mário Vaz of the
PAIGC, with 61% of the vote.
169Sanctions imposed by the international
community following a coup in April 2012
were lifted in July and international aid
resumed. The new government began
paying salary arrears to public servants,
which reduced social tension and the threat
of strikes.
In September, the UN Security Council
extended the mandate of the UN Integrated
Peace-Building Office in Guinea-Bissau
until November.
Also in September, President Vaz
dismissed the Chief-of-Staff of the Armed
Forces, General António Indjai, who led the
April 2012 coup.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Although the election campaign was largely
peaceful, there were some reports of threats,
beatings and abduction of politicians by
security forces in the pre-election period,
apparently intended to coerce support for
certain presidential candidates. In February,
the president and another leading member of
the political party People’s Manifest publicly
stated that they had received death threats,
which they attributed to the security services.
In March, security personnel abducted
Mário Fambé, a leading member of the Social
Renewal Party, in the capital, Bissau, and
took him to the Navy Headquarters where
they beat him to persuade him to support
their favoured candidate. He sustained
serious injuries. The following day, soldiers
took him to the Military Hospital for treatment
and released him.
The day before the second round of
presidential elections in May, some 12
members of the PAIGC were beaten by
security officers in two separate incidents
in Bissau and in the northern town of
Bafata. They included some newly elected
parliamentarians and at least two women.
There were no investigations into
these incidents.
170
IMPUNITY
By the end of the year, no one had been
held accountable for human rights violations
committed in the context of the 2012 coup,
nor for the political killings that had occurred
since 2009.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
A law against domestic violence which was
promulgated in January, had not come into
effect by the end of the year.
Nine people accused of an attack on a
military base in Bissau in October 2012
and convicted in March 2013 after an
unfair trial by a military court were released
in September 2014. Three were released
following an appeal to the High Military Court,
which accepted that there was no evidence
of their participation in the attack. The
remaining six were released two weeks later
following a presidential pardon.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
In February, the UN Special Rapporteur on
extreme poverty and human rights visited
Guinea-Bissau and found that gender
inequality and discrimination were the main
factors underlying poverty. She attributed
the high maternal mortality rate to the fact
that 60% of pregnant women did not receive
adequate ante-natal care. In August the new
government introduced free medical care for
children under five years of age, pregnant
women and the elderly.
GUYANA
Co-operative Republic of Guyana
Head of state and government: Donald Ramotar
Police ill-treatment remained a concern.
Violence against women and girls was also
a concern, and conviction rates for sexual
offences remained low.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15BACKGROUND
Following commitments made during
Guyana’s UN Universal Periodic Review
(UPR) in 2010, the government finally began
public consultations on corporal punishment
in schools. However, consultations into the
abolition of the death penalty, the repeal of
legislation criminalizing consensual same-
sex relations, and discrimination against
LGBTI people, to which the government also
committed in 2010, had yet to begin by the
end of the year.
Following a vote of no confidence by
the opposition in August, in November the
President announced a suspension of the
National Assembly for up to six months,
citing among other things the urgent need to
address “issues relating to economic growth”.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Colwyn Harding alleged that he was
sodomized with a police baton during his
arrest by police on 15 November 2013 in
Timehri. On 2 June 2014, two police officers
were charged with causing actual bodily
harm, and one of them was also charged with
common assault.
On 30 April, 15-year-old Alex Griffith was
allegedly shot in the mouth by a police officer
playing “Russian roulette” with his firearm.
The police officer was investigating an
armed robbery allegedly committed against
a member of the officer’s family. The officer
was charged in June with unlawful assault
and discharging a firearm with intent to maim.
Both cases were still before the courts at
the end of the year.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Physical and sexual violence against women
and girls remained a concern. According
to reports, more than 140 cases of rape
had been reported to the police by early
September. Conviction rates for sexual
offences remained low. The Ministry of Legal
Affairs stated in April that there had been no
conviction for sexual offences in any of the 22
cases heard in 2012 and 2013.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Implementation of the Sexual Offences Act,
enacted in February 2013, and the National
Domestic Violence Policy, launched in June
2008, remained very slow. Concerns were
raised by women’s rights advocates that there
was no political will to fully implement either
act. For example, judicial, law enforcement
and health officials had not received sufficient
training on the new acts, and the public
had not been sufficiently made aware of the
important changes to protect the lives of
women and girls that came into force with
the enactment of these laws. A National Plan
for the Prevention of Sexual Violence had
yet to be drafted, despite the new legislation
stipulating its creation.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In November, the Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights requested precautionary
measures on behalf of staff at the newspaper
Kaieteur News after they received threats.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Consensual sex between men remained
criminalized. There were continuing reports
of discrimination against LGBTI persons,
particularly transgender persons.
Four transgender individuals were fired
upon from a passing vehicle on the night
of 7 April in central Georgetown. According
to reports, the police refused to take their
complaint, and Georgetown Public Hospital
refused to treat them.
DEATH PENALTY
In December, Guyana voted for the fifth
time against a UN resolution to establish
a moratorium on executions, despite the
promise to hold a national consultation on
the issue.
171HAITI
Republic of Haiti
Head of state: Michel Joseph Martelly
Head of government: Laurent Salvador Lamothe
(resigned on 14 December)
More than 80,000 people made homeless
by the January 2010 earthquake remained
displaced. The authorities failed to establish
durable measures to prevent forced
evictions. Concerns remained over the
overall lack of independence of the justice
system. Several human rights defenders
were threatened and attacked.
BACKGROUND
Long-overdue local and legislative elections
for a third of seats in the Senate had not
taken place by the end of 2014. This was
largely due to disagreements between the
government and parliament over the electoral
council, as a result of which six senators
refused to vote for the proposed reform
of the electoral law. On 14 December, the
Prime Minister resigned after a consultative
commission appointed by the President
had recommended his resignation among a
number of measures to be taken to appease
tensions. Concerns remained at the end of
the year over the country’s political stability,
as the terms of another third of the Senate
and all members of the House of Deputies
were due to expire in mid-January 2015.
In October, the UN Security Council
renewed the mandate of the UN Stabilization
Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for an 11 th year
and recommended a radical reduction of its
military component.
Although a significant reduction in the
number of cases was reported in the first half
of 2014, the cholera epidemic persisted. At
least 8,573 people died of cholera between
October 2010 and July 2014. A lawsuit filed
in October 2013 by Haitian and US human
rights groups against the UN for its alleged
172
responsibility for introducing the disease into
Haiti in 2010 was pending before a US court
at the end of 2014.
Following the establishment of the Inter-
Ministerial Committee on human rights, a
number of international and regional human
rights conventions were signed or ratified. In
October, the UN Human Rights Committee
examined Haiti’s initial report. 1
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE
At the end of September, more than 80,000
people made homeless by the January 2010
earthquake were still living in 123 makeshift
camps. Most of the displaced people who
left the camps did so either spontaneously
or after being allocated one-year rental
subsidies. Following his visit to Haiti in
July, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
human rights of internally displaced persons
highlighted the fact that, although there had
been a significant reduction in the number
of displaced people living in camps since
July 2010, the majority of people who left the
camps did not benefit from durable solutions.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
There were fewer forced evictions from
displacement camps and other informal
settlements in 2014 compared with previous
years. However, the authorities failed to
provide remedies to victims of forced
eviction 2 and did not put in place sustainable
measures to avoid forced evictions in the
future. 3
At the end of May, hundreds of families
were made homeless after the government
ordered the demolition of buildings in the
centre of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The vast
majority of affected people did not receive
adequate notice of the demolition and only a
tiny minority of house owners had received
compensation at the time of the demolition.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
According to women’s rights organizations,
violence against women and girls remained
widespread. The government failed to publish
Amnesty International Report 2014/15consolidated statistics on gender-based
violence. A bill on the prevention, prosecution
and eradication of violence against women
drafted in 2011 in collaboration with women’s
rights groups had still not been introduced
in parliament by the end of 2014. Haitian
human rights organizations reported that,
although the number of trials and convictions
in cases of sexual violence had increased,
these represented a tiny fraction of the
reported cases. Bertrand Aristide issued an arrest warrant
against him after he failed to appear to
answer a summons issued the previous
day. In September, the same judge ordered
that Jean-Bertrand Aristide be put under
house arrest. The Port-au-Prince Bar
Association and several Haitian human rights
organizations challenged the legality of these
decisions, which were widely considered to
be politically motivated.
IMPUNITY Several human rights defenders were
attacked, threatened and harassed because
of their legitimate human rights work. 5 In the
vast majority of cases, the authorities failed to
carry out thorough and prompt investigations
or to provide effective protection measures.
In February, the Port-au-Prince Court of
Appeal reversed a 2012 decision by an
investigative judge that former President
Jean-Claude Duvalier could not be
prosecuted for crimes against humanity.
The Court appointed one of its sitting judges
to investigate the allegations of crimes
against humanity involving Jean-Claude
Duvalier among others. However, the failure
to provide additional resources to the judge
or to disclose official documents which
could be useful in the proceedings fuelled
concerns about the capacity of the Haitian
justice system to provide effective remedies
to the victims of past human rights violations.
Following the death of Jean-Claude Duvalier
in October, national and international human
rights organizations called on the authorities
to continue the legal proceedings against his
former collaborators. 4
JUSTICE SYSTEM
Concerns remained about the overall lack
of independence of the justice system. The
High Council of the Judiciary, an institution
considered key for the reform of the justice
system, only started the process of vetting
existing judges towards the end of the year.
The failure to fill several judicial vacancies
exacerbated the problem of prolonged pre-
trial detention. At the end of June, pre-trial
detainees accounted for more than 70% of
the prison population.
In August, a judge investigating corruption
charges against former President Jean-

HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
A number of verbal and physical attacks
against LGBTI people were reported
during the year, most of which were not
thoroughly investigated. According to LGBTI
rights organizations, police officers were
often reluctant to intervene in these cases
and their responses to victims revealed
deeply discriminatory attitudes towards
LGBTI people.
Nobody was brought to justice for attacks
against LGBTI people during and after
country-wide marches against LGBTI rights in
mid-2013.

POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Human rights violations and abuses against
human rights defenders, journalists, women
and girls, LGBTI people, Indigenous, Afro-
descendant and campesino (peasant farmer)
communities continued to be a serious
concern. These violations took place in a
context where impunity for human rights
violations and abuses was endemic and
where levels of organized and common
crime were high. In response to the high levels of crime and
to the weakness, lack of credibility and
widespread corruption of the National Police
Force, some policing functions continued to
be undertaken by the military and special
groups including the Inter-institutional
Security Force (Fuerza de Seguridad
Interinstitucional – Fusina) created in 2014,
and the TIGRES Unit (Investigation Troop
and Security Special Response Group) and
Public Order Military Police (Policía Militar
de Orden Público), both created in 2013.
Concerns were raised that these groups
were not adequately trained in the respect
and protection of human rights, following a
number of cases of human rights violations
committed during the exercise of policing
functions in previous years.
Honduras also experienced a proliferation
of firearms and of private security companies.
It was legally permitted to possess and carry
up to five firearms, and given the high levels
of insecurity, many people carried firearms
to protect themselves. Following a visit in
2013, the UN Working Group on the use
of mercenaries stated that private security
companies were committing abuses with the
permission or participation of the police and
the military, and with impunity.
BACKGROUND JUSTICE SYSTEM
President Juan Orlando Hernández was
sworn in on 27 January with a four-
year mandate. His commitment to the
implementation of the Public Policy and
National Plan of Action on Human Rights,
adopted in 2013, had yet to be reflected in
specific policies, measures and actions at the
end of the year.
According to UN figures, Honduras had the
world’s highest homicide rate. Poverty and
extreme poverty continued to undermine the
realization of human rights for large sectors The Attorney General’s Office continued
to be overwhelmed by the high levels of
violence and crime in the country. In April
2013, the then Attorney General stated that
the Public Prosecution Service only had the
capacity to investigate 20% of the country’s
homicides. The Attorney General and his
deputy were subsequently suspended and
then removed from their posts. New officials
were elected to these posts; however, human
rights organizations described the election

HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Scores of human rights defenders, including
Indigenous and campesino leaders, LGBTI
activists, justice officials and journalists
were victims of human rights violations.
They suffered killings, physical violence,
kidnapping, threats, harassment and
verbal attacks.
On 24 February, Mario Argeñal became
the target of intimidation and harassment for
demanding justice from the authorities for the
death of his brother, journalist Carlos Argeñal,
who was shot dead at his home in Danlí,
department of El Paraíso on 7 December
2013. 1
On 4 June, a member of the Committee of
the Families of the Detained and Disappeared
in Honduras (COFADEH) was kidnapped in
Tegucigalpa for two hours; she was physically
attacked, almost strangled with a cable and
robbed before being released. 2
On 27 August, prominent campesino
leader Margarita Murillo was shot dead in
the community of El Planón, north western
Honduras. 3
In June, Congress discussed the first draft
of the Law to Protect Journalists, Human
Rights Defenders and Justice System
Workers. In August, following national and
international pressure, the draft law was
finally shared with civil society. The law was
yet to be approved at the end of the year, as
was a mechanism for the effective protection
of those at risk.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND AFRO-
DESCENDANT COMMUNITIES
Indigenous Peoples and Garífuna (Afro-
descendant) communities continued to face
discrimination and inequality, including in
relation to their rights to land, housing, water,
health and education. Large-scale projects
continued to be carried out on their lands
without their consultation or their free, prior
and informed consent. Indigenous and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Garífuna leaders faced fabricated criminal
charges and were the target of attacks
and intimidation in reprisal for their work
in defence of human rights. On 17 July,
members of a Garífuna community in north-
eastern Honduras, including human rights
defender Miriam Miranda, were temporarily
abducted by armed men after discovering an
illegal runway used by drug traffickers on the
community’s territory. 4
LAND DISPUTES
Longstanding land disputes between peasant
communities and powerful landowners
were one of the underlying causes of the
high levels of violence faced by campesino
communities, such as in the region of
Bajo Aguán. In August, the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights expressed
serious concerns about the situation in Bajo
Aguán following a series of violent evictions
as well as threats against and arrests of
various campesino leaders, who had been
beneficiaries of precautionary measures
granted by the Commission in May.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
Violence against women and girls was rife.
Civil society groups reported 636 femicides
in 2013, the highest number since 2005.
Since 2013, the Honduran Criminal Code has
recognized the crime of femicide. Between
December 2013 and January 2014 there was
a wave of killings of women sex workers in
San Pedro Sula city, northern Honduras. 5
Abortion continued to be banned in all
circumstances. The government had yet to
re-establish the legality of the emergency
contraceptive pill, which had been prohibited
in 2009 by decree (Acuerdo Ministerial)
under the then de facto authorities.

HUNGARY
Hungary
Head of state: János Áder
Head of government: Viktor Orbán
The government launched smear campaigns
against several NGOs for alleged funding
irregularities and ordered audits of
their accounts. Roma continued to face
discrimination in access to health care,
housing, and by law enforcement agencies.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled
that the obligatory re-registration of religious
organizations violated the right to freedom
of religion.
BACKGROUND
In general elections in April, the ruling Fidesz
party secured a two-thirds parliamentary
majority with 45% of the vote. The OSCE
criticized the government for amending
electoral legislation and noted that this and
other legislation, including the Constitution,
had been amended using procedures that
circumvented the requirement for public
consultation and debate.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION – NGOS
The government adopted an increasingly
hostile attitude towards critical civil society
groups and NGOs, which they accused of
acting in the pay and interests of foreign
governments. 1 In April 2014, the Chief of the
176
Prime Minister’s cabinet alleged that Norway
Grants – a government-backed funding
vehicle for social cohesion projects in 16
EU member states – was financing groups
linked to opposition parties. The Norwegian
government and the NGOs in question
dismissed the allegations.
In June, the Prime Minister’s Office ordered
the Hungarian Government Control Office
(KEHI) to carry out an audit of NGOs involved
in distributing and receiving the European
Economic Area (EEA)/Norway Grants. The
Norwegian government and the NGOs in
question strongly contested the legality of
the audit, as the funds were not part of the
Hungarian state budget and the authority to
conduct or order audits of the grants resided
with a Financial Mechanism Office in Brussels
under bilateral agreements between Hungary
and Norway.
In July, the Council of Europe
Commissioner for Human Rights denounced
the government’s “stigmatizing rhetoric...
questioning the legitimacy of NGOs”. The
Hungarian authorities continued with their
allegations against NGOs. In a speech in
July the Prime Minister referred to the NGOs
involved with the Norway Grants as “paid
political activists who are attempting to
enforce foreign interests here in Hungary”.
On 8 September, police raided the offices
of Ökotárs and Demnet, two of the NGOs
responsible for the distribution of the Norway
Grants. Their files and computer servers
were confiscated. The basis of the police
investigation was reportedly allegations of
mismanagement of the funds. 2
Also in September, the KEHI initiated
procedures to suspend the tax numbers of
the four NGOs involved in the distribution of
Norway Grants, alleging non-co-operation with
the government-imposed audit. The NGOs
denied the allegations.
In October, the KEHI released a report
based on its audit, and announced it would
seek criminal sanctions against several NGOs.
In December, the suspension of the tax
numbers entered into force in the case of at
Amnesty International Report 2014/15least one of the NGOs in question. The NGOs
aimed to challenge the suspension in a court
of law.
In July, the first instance court held that the
spokesperson of the Fidesz party damaged
the reputation of an NGO, the Hungarian
Helsinki Committee, when he claimed that
it was paid by “American speculators... to
attack the Hungarian government”. The
spokesperson appealed against the decision.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Roma were subjected to ethnic profiling and
disproportionately targeted by the police for
minor administrative offences. In September,
the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child
noted that Roma continued to be denied
health services, including emergency aid
services, and were discriminated against by
health practitioners.
About 450 residents of the predominantly
Roma neighbourhood known as Numbered
Streets, in the city of Miskolc, were put
at risk of forced eviction and possible
homelessness. 3 In May, the local government
adopted a decree declaring the houses in
the neighbourhood “old and inadequate”
and announced that the tenancy agreements
would be terminated. The municipality stated
that “there was no place for slums” in the city
and that its plans to demolish the buildings
were supported by 35,000 individuals who
signed the petition calling for an eviction.
In August, the municipality evicted two
families; approximately 50 other families
were expecting eviction notices at the end of
the year.
members. The European Court ruled that
the government should reach an agreement
with the churches on the restoration of their
registration and on just compensation for
any damages.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Asylum-seekers were frequently detained
pending the determination of their claims.
In a report published in May, the Hungarian
Helsinki Committee (HHC) stated that 40% of
male first-time asylum-seekers were detained
and that the judicial review of asylum
detention was ineffective. In September, the
HHC reported that in 2013 it observed 262
cases of expelled or returned individuals
trying to enter Hungary through the Serbian-
Hungarian border.
In September, the UN Committee on
the Rights of the Child criticized Hungary
for holding children seeking asylum and
unaccompanied migrant children in
administrative detention.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In May, the European Court of Human Rights
ruled that the possibility of life imprisonment
without parole – a provision included in
the Constitution of Hungary adopted in
2011 – amounted to an inhuman and
degrading punishment.

FREEDOM OF RELIGION
In September, the Grand Chamber of the
European Court of Human Rights upheld a
decision that Hungary violated the right to
freedom of religion when it adopted a law in
2011 that required all recognized churches
and religious organizations to re-register.
The law only allowed them to do so if they
could prove that they had existed in Hungary
for at least 20 years and had at least 1,000

177INDIA
Republic of India
Head of state: Pranab Mukherjee
Head of government: Narendra Modi (replaced
Manmohan Singh in May)
Impunity was widespread for human rights
abuses by state and non-state actors.
Despite progressive legal reform and court
rulings, state authorities often failed to
prevent and at times committed crimes
against Indian citizens, including children,
women, Dalits and Adivasi (Indigenous)
people. Arbitrary arrest and detention,
torture and extrajudicial executions often
went unpunished. The overburdened and
underfunded criminal justice system
contributed to justice being denied to those
who suffered abuses, and to violations of
the fair trial rights of the accused. Violence
by armed groups in Jammu and Kashmir,
northeastern states and areas where Maoist
forces operated continued to put civilians
at risk.
BACKGROUND
National elections in May saw a government
led by the Bharatiya Janata Party come
to power with a landslide victory. Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, who campaigned
on promises of good governance and
development for all, made commitments
to improve access to financial services
and sanitation for people living in poverty.
However, the government took steps
towards reducing requirements to consult
with communities affected by corporate-
led projects. The authorities continued
to violate people’s rights to privacy and
freedom of expression. There was a rise in
communal violence in Uttar Pradesh and
some other states, and corruption, caste-
based discrimination and caste violence
remained pervasive.
178
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Arbitrary arrests and detentions of
protesters, journalists and human rights
defenders persisted. National Human
Rights Commission data indicated that 123
illegal arrests and 203 cases of unlawful
detention were reported from April to July.
The authorities used laws authorizing
administrative detention to detain journalists
and human rights defenders in custody
under executive orders without charge or trial.
Adivasi villagers in Maoist-affected areas in
central India also remained at risk of being
arbitrarily arrested and detained.
“Anti-terror” laws such as the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, which did not
meet international human rights standards,
were also used. In May, the Supreme Court
acquitted six men convicted under anti-terror
laws for attacking the Akshardham temple
in Gujarat in 2002, ruling that there was no
evidence against them and the investigation
had been incompetent.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Human rights abuses by armed groups
were reported in various regions, including
Jammu and Kashmir, north-eastern states
and central India. Armed groups killed and
injured civilians and destroyed property in
indiscriminate and at times targeted attacks.
Their actions also displaced people. Clashes
between security forces and armed Maoist
groups led to several civilian deaths.
In the lead-up to national elections in
May, armed groups allegedly killed local
government officials and electoral officials
in Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and
Chhattisgarh states, in order to intimidate
voters and disrupt elections.
In January and May, armed groups in
Assam were accused of killing dozens
of Muslims, and in December, they were
accused of killing scores of Adivasis.
Armed groups in other north-eastern states
were also accused of targeting civilians,
instigating violence and causing large-scale
displacement.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15CHILDREN'S RIGHTS
In August, the government introduced a bill to
Parliament seeking to amend juvenile justice
laws to allow for children aged between 16
and 18 to be prosecuted and punished as
adults in cases of serious crimes. India’s
official child rights and mental health
institutions opposed the move.
Protests over the rape of a six-year-old girl
in a school in Bangalore in July drew attention
to the inadequate enforcement of laws on
child sexual abuse.
Incidents of corporal punishment were
reported from several states, despite its
prohibition under law. Laws requiring private
schools to reserve 25% of places at the entry
level for children from disadvantaged families
were poorly implemented. Dalit and Adivasi
children continued to face discrimination
in school.
In June, the UN Committee on the Rights
of the Child expressed concern about the
disparity in access to education, health care,
safe water and sanitation among different
groups of children. Child labour and child
trafficking remained serious issues. In
October, Kailash Satyarthi, a children‘s rights
campaigner who works on these issues, was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
COMMUNAL VIOLENCE
A string of communally charged incidents
in Uttar Pradesh prior to elections led to an
increase in tensions between Hindu and
Muslim communities. Three people were
killed in clashes in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh
state, in July. Politicians were accused of,
and in some cases criminally charged with,
making provocative speeches. Communal
clashes also occurred in some other states.
In December, Hindu groups were accused
of forcibly converting several Muslims and
Christians to Hinduism.
In January, survivors of violence between
Hindus and Muslims in Muzzafarnagar, Uttar
Pradesh, in late 2013 were forcibly evicted
from relief camps. Investigations into the
violence were incomplete. Thousands of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
people, mainly Muslims, remained displaced
at the end of the year.
November marked the 30th anniversary
of violence in Delhi in 1984 which led to the
massacre of thousands of Sikhs. Hundreds
of criminal cases closed by the police citing
lack of evidence were not reopened, despite
large public demonstrations seeking an end
to impunity.
Progress in investigations and trials
in cases related to the 2002 violence in
Gujarat, which killed at least 2,000 people,
mostly Muslims, continued to be slow. In
November, the Nanavati-Mehta Commission,
appointed in 2002 to investigate the violence,
submitted its final report to the Gujarat state
government. The report was not made public.
Ethnic clashes over the disputed Nagaland-
Assam border in August resulted in the
deaths of 10 people and the displacement
of over 10,000. Caste-based violence was
also reported in several states including Uttar
Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
In September, the Supreme Court cancelled
over 200 coal mining licences which it said
were granted arbitrarily. The Environment
Ministry weakened existing mechanisms for
consultation with communities affected by
industrial projects, particularly coal mining.
The Ministry also lifted moratoriums on new
industries in critically polluted areas.
The authorities and businesses failed to
meaningfully consult local communities in
several instances. In August, a subsidiary
of UK-based Vedanta Resources conducted
a public hearing towards expanding its
alumina refinery in Lanjigarh, Odisha state,
without addressing existing impacts or
adequately informing and consulting affected
communities.
In December, the government passed a
temporary law which removed requirements
related to seeking the consent of affected
communities and assessing social impact
when state authorities acquired land for
certain projects.
179Thousands of people remained at risk
of being forcibly evicted from their homes
and lands for large infrastructure projects.
Particularly vulnerable were Adivasi
communities living near new and expanding
mines and dams.
December marked the 30th anniversary of
the 1984 Bhopal gas leak disaster. Survivors
continued to experience serious health
problems linked to the leak and to continuing
pollution from the factory site. In November, a
Bhopal court asked for its criminal summons
against the Dow Chemical Company to be
re-issued, after the company failed to comply
with an earlier summons. Also in November,
the Indian government agreed to use medical
and scientific data to increase a multi-million
US dollar compensation claim against Union
Carbide. The Indian government had yet to
clean up the contaminated factory site.
DEATH PENALTY
In January, the Supreme Court ruled that
undue delay in the carrying out of death
sentences amounted to torture, and that the
execution of people suffering from mental
illness would be unconstitutional. The Court
also laid down guidelines for safeguarding the
rights of people under a sentence of death.
In April, three men were sentenced to
death by a Mumbai court under a new
law enacted in 2013 which introduced the
death penalty for those convicted in multiple
cases of rape. In December, the government
introduced to Parliament an anti-hijacking bill
which seeks to impose the death penalty for
hijacking that results in the death of a hostage
or security personnel.
EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS
Proceedings continued before the Supreme
Court relating to a petition seeking
investigations into over 1,500 alleged “fake
encounters” – a term referring to staged
extrajudicial executions – in Manipur state.
Courts in Delhi, Bihar and Punjab convicted
police personnel of being involved in fake
encounter killings. The National Human
180
Rights Commission ordered compensation
for the families of people killed in a number
of fake encounters. It also expressed concern
about fake encounter killings in Uttar Pradesh
by the state police.
In February, the country’s top investigative
agency charged former officers of India’s
internal intelligence agency with murder
and kidnapping in an investigation into a
fake encounter case in Gujarat in 2004. The
Gujarat and Rajasthan state governments
reinstated into service police officers on
trial for their alleged involvement in fake
encounter cases after they were released on
bail from pre-trial detention.
In September, the Supreme Court laid
down new requirements for investigations
into deaths in encounters with the police,
including that the deaths be investigated by
a team from a different police station or a
separate investigative wing.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Laws on criminal defamation and sedition
which fell short of international standards
were used to harass and persecute
journalists, human rights defenders and
others for peacefully exercising their right
to free expression. The government also
used broad and imprecise laws to curb
free expression on the internet. Around the
general election in May, a number of people
were arrested for statements made about
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which police
said amounted to criminal offences.
The authorities also implemented and
expanded large-scale surveillance of
telephone and internet communications,
without disclosing details of these projects or
safeguards to prevent their misuse.
IMPUNITY – SECURITY FORCES
Despite some signs of progress, almost
absolute impunity for violations by Indian
security forces continued. Legislation
providing virtual immunity from prosecution
such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act
and Disturbed Areas Act were still in force in
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Jammu and Kashmir and parts of north-east
India, despite ongoing protests.
In January, the army dismissed without
trial charges of murder and conspiracy filed
against five of its personnel by the Central
Bureau of Investigation. The Supreme Court
had ruled in 2012 that the army should try its
personnel by court-martial for the extrajudicial
executions of five villagers from Pathribal,
Jammu and Kashmir, in 2000. In September,
an army court-martial convicted five soldiers
of killing three men in an extrajudicial
execution in Machil, Jammu and Kashmir
state, in 2010. In November, an army
investigation charged nine soldiers in a case
involving the killing of two Kashmiri teenagers
in Budgam district.
Perpetrators of past violations in Jammu
and Kashmir, Nagaland, Manipur, Punjab and
Assam continued to evade justice.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
The Supreme Court agreed to hear a
petition seeking a review of its ruling
in December 2013 which effectively
recriminalized consensual same-sex sexual
activity by upholding Section 377 of the
Indian Penal Code. In the run-up to the
2014 parliamentary elections, prominent
political parties committed to decriminalizing
homosexuality.
In April, the Supreme Court granted
legal recognition to transgender people in a
landmark judgment. It directed authorities
to recognize transgender persons’ self-
identification as male, female or a “third
gender” and put in place social welfare
policies and quotas in education and
employment. However, cases of harassment
and violence against transgender people
continued to be reported.
WORKERS’ RIGHTS
The lack of effective regulation of visa brokers
and rogue recruiting agents continued to
put Indian migrant workers travelling to
Middle East countries at risk of human rights
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
abuses including forced labour and human
trafficking.
Hundreds of Indian migrants including
46 nurses were stranded in Iraq as fighting
between armed groups and the Iraqi
government intensified. In June, 39 Indian
migrants in Iraq were abducted and were
believed to be still held by armed groups at
the end of the year.
Bonded labour remained widespread.
Millions of people were forced to work as
bonded labourers in industries including
brick-making, mining, silk and cotton
production, and agriculture. A number of
cases were reported of domestic workers,
mostly women, suffering abuses by
their employers.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
Adivasi activists and prisoners of conscience
Soni Sori and Lingaram Kodopi were granted
bail by the Supreme Court in February. Soni
Sori stood for parliamentary elections in May.
Manipuri activist Irom Sharmila continued
her 14-year hunger strike, demanding the
repeal of the draconian Armed Forces Special
Powers Act. She was detained on charges
of attempted suicide and was released
on 20 August by a court which ruled that
the charges were baseless. However, she
was rearrested two days later for the same
alleged offence.
PROLONGED PRE-TRIAL DETENTION
Prolonged pre-trial detention and
overcrowding in prisons persisted. As of
December 2013, over 278,000 prisoners –
more than two-thirds of the country's prison
population – were pre-trial detainees. Dalits,
Adivasis and Muslims continued to be
disproportionately represented in the pre-trial
prison population. Indiscriminate arrests,
slow investigations and prosecutions, weak
legal aid systems and inadequate safeguards
against lengthy detention periods contributed
to the problem.
In September, the Supreme Court directed
district judges to immediately identify and
181release all pre-trial detainees who had
been in prison for over half of the term they
would have faced if convicted. Following
advocacy by Amnesty International India, the
government of Karnataka state directed state
authorities to set up review committees to
monitor lengthy pre-trial detention.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
Authorities used the Foreign Contribution
(Regulation) Act to harass NGOs and civil
society organizations that received funding
from abroad. In particular, groups critical
of large infrastructure, mining and nuclear
power projects faced repeated queries,
threats of investigations and blocking of
foreign funding by the government.
In June, media organizations reported
on a classified document prepared by
India’s internal intelligence agency, which
described a number of foreign-funded
NGOs as “negatively impacting economic
development”.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment continued to
be used in state detention, particularly against
women, Dalits and Adivasis. A deeply flawed
anti-torture bill lapsed with the end of the
central government's term in May.
In August, the Bombay High Court directed
the installation of closed-circuit television
cameras in all police stations in Maharashtra
to curb the use of torture.
Reports of crimes against women rose,
but under-reporting was still considered to be
widespread. Dalit women and girls continued
to face multiple levels of caste-based
discrimination and violence. Self-appointed
village councils issued illegal decrees ordering
punishments against women for perceived
social transgressions.
In April, the UN Special Rapporteur on
violence against women drew attention to
the inability of the authorities to ensure
accountability and redress for survivors of
violence. In July, the CEDAW Committee
recommended the government allocate
resources to set up special courts, complaints
procedures and support services to better
enforce laws.
In November, 16 women died after
participating in a botched mass sterilization
drive in Chhattisgarh. The government’s
target-driven approach to family planning
continued to allow for compromises on
the quality of health care and curtailed
women’s right to choose appropriate family
planning methods.
INDONESIA
Republic of Indonesia
Head of state and government: Joko Widodo
(replaced Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in October)
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Violence against women remained
widespread. The authorities did not
effectively implement new laws on crimes
against women that were enacted in 2013,
or undertake important police and judicial
reforms to ensure that they were enforced.
Rape within marriage was still not recognized
as a crime if the wife was over 15 years of
age. A number of public officials and political
leaders made statements that appeared to
justify crimes against women, contributing to
a culture of impunity.
182
Security forces faced persistent allegations
of human rights violations, including torture
and other ill-treatment. Political activists
from the Papua region and Maluku province
continued to be arrested and imprisoned for
their peaceful political expression and at
least 60 prisoners of conscience remained
imprisoned. Intimidation and attacks
against religious minorities continued. A
new Islamic Criminal Code by-law in Aceh
province, passed in September, increased
offences punishable by caning. There
Amnesty International Report 2014/15was a lack of progress in ensuring truth,
justice and reparations for victims of past
human rights violations. No executions
were reported.
BACKGROUND
Joko Widodo was inaugurated in October as
the new President; he had made pledges
during his election campaign to address
serious past human rights abuses, protect
freedom of religion, reform the police and
open up access to the Papua region. 1 On
30 April and 1 May, the UN Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
reviewed Indonesia’s initial report. In June
the UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child reviewed Indonesia’s third and fourth
periodic reports.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Reports continued of serious human rights
violations by the police and military, including
unlawful killings, unnecessary or excessive
use of force, torture and other cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment, and
enforced disappearance.
In February, seven people were tortured
or otherwise ill-treated during arrest and
interrogation after police and military
personnel raided a gathering organized by the
armed Papuan pro-independence National
Liberation Army in Sasawa village, Yapen
Islands district, Papua province. Security
officers chained the men’s hands together
and beat and kicked them. They were forced
to crawl around the village as the beatings
continued and at least two men alleged
that they were given electric shocks by the
police. According to their lawyers, none of
the men were involved or had links with the
armed pro-independence struggle. They
were each charged with rebellion, convicted
and sentenced to three and a half years’
imprisonment in November by the Sorong
District Court. No independent investigation
into the incident had begun by the end of
the year.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In March, eight men from the Suku Anak
Dalam Indigenous community of Bungku
village, Batanghari district, Jambi province,
were tortured or otherwise ill-treated after
protesting against the operation of a palm
oil company near their village. Puji Hartono
died from his injuries after his hands were
tied behind his back with a rope and he was
beaten by military personnel and company
security guards. Titus Simanjuntak was
stripped and beaten by military personnel
and forced to lick his blood stains on the
floor while being stepped on. Police officers
watched as the abuses took place. In August,
the Palembang military court convicted
six military personnel of ill-treatment
and sentenced them to three months’
imprisonment. At the end of the year, no one
was known to have been held accountable for
the killing of Puji Hartono.
In October, six military personnel were
convicted by a military court in Medan of
the abduction and ill-treatment of Dedek
Khairudin and sentenced to between 14 and
17 months’ imprisonment. Dedek Khairudin
was subjected to enforced disappearance
in November 2013 after being detained by
a military intelligence officer from the Army
Resort Military Command (Korem 011/LW)
and at least eight marines from Pangkalan
Brandan region in North Sumatra province.
His whereabouts remained unclarified at the
end of the year.
In December, at least four men were killed
and over a dozen injured when security
forces, both police and military, allegedly
opened fire on a crowd that was protesting at
the Karel Gobai field near the Paniai District
Military Command in Papua province. The
crowd was protesting against soldiers from the
Special Team Battalion 753 who had allegedly
beaten a child from Ipakije village. No one
had been held accountable for the attack by
the end of the year.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Cases continued to be documented of the
arrest and detention of peaceful political
183activists, particularly in areas with a history of
pro-independence movements such as Papua
and Maluku.
On 25 April, 10 political activists from
Maluku province were arrested by police for
planning to commemorate the anniversary
of the Republic of South Maluku (RMS)
movement’s declaration of independence and
carrying “Benang Raja” flags – a prohibited
symbol of the movement. Nine of them were
subsequently charged with “rebellion” under
Articles 106 and 110 of the Criminal Code
(crimes against the security of the state).
Their trial began in September and had not
been completed by the end of the year.
Two French journalists were arrested on
6 August in Wamena, Papua province, after
making a documentary on the separatist
movement in the Papuan region. In October,
they were convicted by the Jayapura
District Court of immigration violations and
sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.
Areki Wanimbo, Head of the Lani Besar Tribal
Council (Dewan Adat) who had met the two
journalists, was also arrested by police on
the same day and accused of supporting
separatist activities. He was later charged with
“rebellion” and was awaiting trial at the end
of the year.
At least nine people remained detained or
imprisoned under blasphemy laws solely for
their religious views or the manifestation of
their beliefs, or for the lawful exercise of their
right to freedom of expression. 2
In June, Abraham Sujoko was convicted
by the Dompu District Court in West Nusa
Tenggara province for “defamation of religion”
under Article 27(3) of the Information and
Electronic Transaction Law. He was sentenced
to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of
3,500,000 rupiah (US$288). Abraham Sujoko
had posted a video of himself on YouTube
saying that the Ka’bah (an Islamic holy shrine
in Mecca) was a “mere stone idol”, and had
urged Muslims not to face it while praying.
184
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
Harassment, intimidation and attacks against
religious minorities persisted, fuelled by
discriminatory laws and regulations at both
national and local levels.
In May, the Bekasi city authority issued
a decree to close the Al-Misbah Ahmadiyya
mosque in Bekasi, West Java province,
referring to a 2008 Joint Ministerial Decree
forbidding the Ahmadiyya community from
promoting their activities and spreading
their religious teachings. The Bekasi
local government police then locked and
sealed the mosque. On 26 June, the local
government in Ciamis district, West Java
province, closed down the Nur Khilafat
Ahmadiyya mosque, citing the need to
“maintain religious harmony” and to stop
the spread of a “deviant interpretation of
Islamic teaching”. Days before, hundreds
of supporters of hardline Islamist groups
had protested outside the office of the local
district chief demanding the closure of the
mosque. In October, the local government in
Depok district, West Java, closed down the
Al-Hidayah Ahmadiyya mosque to prevent
“social disharmony”.
By the end of the year, a displaced Shi’a
community from Sampang, East Java, who
were attacked and evicted by an anti-
Shi’a mob in 2012, remained in temporary
accommodation in Sidoarjo and prevented
from returning to their homes. The authorities
failed to provide remedies for a displaced
Ahmadiyya community in Lombok, West Nusa
Tenggara, forcibly evicted by a mob from their
homes in 2006.
Concerns about the “forced relocation
of religious minorities, particularly Shi’a
and Ahmadiyya communities, which were
instigated by mobs and based on religious
incitement” were raised by the UN Special
Rapporteur on adequate housing in March. In
May, the UN Committee on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights raised concerns about
the situation of several groups, including
displaced religious communities, which
suffered “multiple discriminations”.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In November, the newly elected Minister
of Religious Affairs and the Minister of Home
Affairs both stated that the government would
make the protection of minority rights one of
its priorities.
IMPUNITY
Victims of past human rights violations and
abuses continued to demand justice, truth
and reparation for crimes under international
law which occurred under the rule of
former President Suharto (1965-1998) and
during the subsequent reformasi period.
These included unlawful killings, rape and
other crimes of sexual violence, enforced
disappearances, and torture and other
ill-treatment. No progress was reported on
numerous cases of alleged gross violations
of human rights that were submitted by the
National Human Rights Commission (Komnas
HAM) to the Attorney General’s office after a
preliminary pro-justicia inquiry was conducted
by the Commission.
Former President Yudhoyono failed
to act on certain recommendations by
Parliament from 2009: to bring to justice
those involved in the enforced disappearance
of 13 pro-democracy activists in 1997 and
1998, to conduct an immediate search
for activists who had disappeared, and to
provide rehabilitation and compensation to
their families.
By the end of the year, Komnas HAM
had completed only two out of five pro-
justicia inquiries into “gross human rights
violations” during the Aceh conflict (1989-
2005). These included the 1999 Simpang
KKA incident in North Aceh when the military
shot dead 21 protesters, and the Jamboe
Keupok case in South Aceh where four
people were shot dead and 12 burned alive
by soldiers in May 2003.
An Aceh Truth and Reconciliation by-law
(qanun) passed in December 2013 was not
implemented. No progress was reported
on a new law on a national Truth and
Reconciliation Commission.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
More than 10 years after the murder of
prominent human rights defender Munir Said
Thalib, the authorities had failed to bring all
the perpetrators to justice.
The government failed to implement
recommendations made by the bilateral
Indonesia-Timor-Leste Commission of Truth
and Friendship, in particular to establish
a commission for disappeared persons
tasked with identifying the whereabouts
of all children from Timor-Leste who were
separated from their parents around the 1999
independence referendum.
CRUEL, INHUMAN OR
DEGRADING PUNISHMENT
At least 76 people were caned in Aceh for
Shari’a offences including gambling, drinking
alcohol and adultery during the year. In
September, the Aceh parliament passed a
new by-law, the Islamic Criminal Code, which
expanded the use of caning as punishment
to other “crimes”, including same-sex sexual
relations and intimacy between unmarried
couples. There were concerns that the
definition and evidentiary procedures related
to the offence of rape and sexual abuse in
the by-law did not meet international human
rights standards. The Aceh Islamic Criminal
Code applied to Muslims in Aceh province.
Non-Muslims could also be convicted under
the by-law of offences not currently covered
by the Indonesian Criminal Code.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
By the end of the year, the House of
Representatives had yet to pass a Domestic
Worker Protection Bill, leaving millions of
domestic workers, the majority of them
women and girls, vulnerable to economic
exploitation and human rights abuses.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
In February the Ministry of Health issued a
new regulation withdrawing a 2010 regulation
authorizing certain medical practitioners,
such as doctors, midwives and nurses, to
conduct “female circumcision”. By the
185end of the year, the government had yet to
pass specific legislation prohibiting female
genital mutilation.
Government Regulation No. 61/2014
on Reproductive Health, an implementing
regulation to the 2009 Health Law, was issued
in July 2014, restricting to 40 days the time
period for rape survivors to access legal
abortion. It was feared that this shortened
timeframe would prevent many rape survivors
from being able to access safe legal abortion.
DEATH PENALTY
No executions were reported. At least two
death sentences were handed down during
the year and at least 140 people remained
under sentence of death.

IRAN
Islamic Republic of Iran
Head of state: Ayatollah Sayed 'Ali Khamenei
(Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran)
Head of government: Hassan Rouhani (President)
The authorities restricted freedoms of
expression, association and assembly,
arresting, detaining and prosecuting
in unfair trials minority and women’s
rights activists, journalists, human rights
defenders and others who voiced dissent.
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
prevalent and were committed with
impunity. Women and ethnic and religious
minorities faced pervasive discrimination in
law and practice. Flogging and amputation
sentences were reportedly carried out, some
186
in public. Executions continued at a high
rate; juvenile offenders were among those
executed. Judges continued to impose
sentences of execution by stoning, although
none were reported to have been carried out.
BACKGROUND
The June 2013 election of Hassan
Rouhani as President raised hopes that
his administration would introduce much
needed human rights reforms, but little
had been achieved by the end of 2014.
Attempts by the administration to relax official
controls on academic freedom, for example,
prompted a backlash from conservatives
within parliament.
Negotiations continued between Iran and
the USA and other states amid persistent
tensions over Iran’s nuclear development
programme and the impact on Iran of
international financial and other sanctions.
In November 2013, an interim agreement
had brought Iran some relief from these
sanctions in return for concessions on
nuclear enrichment.
A Charter of Citizens’ Rights proposed by
the presidency and opened for consultation
in 2013 remained in draft form throughout
2014. It failed to afford adequate protection
of human rights, in particular the rights
to life, non-discrimination, and protection
from torture.
The UN Human Rights Council renewed
the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on
the situation of human rights in Iran in March
but the Iranian authorities continued to block
visits to Iran by him or other UN Human
Rights Council experts.
In October, the UN Human Rights Council
considered Iran’s human rights record
under the UN Universal Periodic Review
(UPR) process. The Council noted Iran’s dire
human rights situation and the authorities’
failure to implement the recommendations
they had accepted following the 2010
UPR. Iran withheld its position on all the
recommendations made until the next
Amnesty International Report 2014/15session of the UN Human Rights Council in
March 2015.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
The authorities maintained curbs on freedom
of expression and the media, including by
jamming foreign satellite broadcasting and
closing media outlets. Authorities retained
the mandatory dress code for women and
the criminalization of dress code violations
under the Islamic Penal Code. Opposition
figures, Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi
Karoubi and Zahra Rahnavard remained
under house arrest without charge or trial,
despite their deteriorating health. 1 Scores
of prisoners of conscience were serving
prison terms for peacefully exercising their
human rights. Among them were government
critics, journalists, lawyers, trade unionists,
student activists, and minority and women’s
rights activists.
The authorities continued to target
journalists, who faced arrest, detention,
imprisonment and flogging for critical
reporting of the authorities. 2 In August, two
photographers who criticized in writing a book
of photographs published by a government
official in the city of Qazvin, northwest Iran,
were sentenced to floggings.
Online activists also faced prosecution.
In May, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran
convicted eight people on charges including
“insulting religious sanctities” and “insulting
the authorities” for posts on the website
Facebook, and sentenced them to prison
terms of between seven and 20 years.
Although the Supreme Leader, President
Rouhani and other senior officials all used
social media websites such as Facebook,
Twitter and Instagram to communicate, the
authorities continued to filter such websites.
In September, a senior judiciary official
instructed the Minister of Communications
and Information Technology to take measures
within a month to “block and effectively
control the content” of social media websites
after the circulation of jokes deemed offensive
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
to the former Supreme Leader, Ayatollah
Khomeini. The authorities said they had
arrested 11 people in relation to the jokes.
In October, authorities in the cities of
Tehran and Esfahan arrested protesters who
were demanding an end to violence against
women following a series of acid attacks
against women in Esfahan. One of those
arrested remained in detention at the end of
the year. At least four journalists were also
arrested in connection with their coverage of
the acid attacks.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment, particularly
during pre-trial detention, remained
common, facilitated by routine denial of
access to lawyers and the virtual impunity
of perpetrators. Methods reported included
prolonged solitary confinement, confinement
in uncomfortably small spaces, severe
beatings, and threats against detainees’
family members. The authorities generally
failed to investigate allegations of torture and
prosecute and punish those responsible.
The authorities systematically denied
detainees and prisoners access to adequate
medical care, including for injuries resulting
from torture or health problems exacerbated
by harsh prison conditions.
A revised Code of Criminal Procedure
passed in April failed to address the
inadequacy of national laws to afford
detainees effective protection against torture
and other ill-treatment. It denied detainees
access to lawyers for up to one week after
arrest in cases concerning national security
and some other offences, and provided no
clear and comprehensive definition of torture
conforming to international law.
State security and intelligence agencies
operated their own detention facilities outside
the control of the State Prison Organization, in
breach of national law. Torture and other ill-
treatment was common in these facilities. In
some cases, the authorities subjected death
row prisoners to enforced disappearance
187by moving them to such facilities prior
to execution.
Sentences of flogging and amputations
continued to be imposed for a wide range
of offences, including alcohol consumption,
eating in public during Ramadan, and
theft. These sentences were increasingly
implemented in public.
In April, security officials assaulted
prisoners held in Section 350 of Tehran’s Evin
Prison during a search of their cells, beating
and injuring many of them. The authorities
reportedly failed to investigate the incident or
prosecute and punish the perpetrators. 3 In
August, authorities reportedly used excessive
force against inmates of Ghezel Hesar Prison
in the city of Karaj who protested against the
transfer of 14 death row prisoners to solitary
confinement prior to execution.
UNFAIR TRIALS
The judiciary continued to lack independence
and remained subject to interference by
the security authorities. Trials, particularly
those before Revolutionary Courts, were
largely unfair.
The new Code of Criminal Procedure
enhanced detainees’ access to lawyers but
did not guarantee access from the time of
arrest, required to help safeguard detainees
against torture. The Code allowed prosecutors
to prevent lawyers accessing some or all of
the case documents against their clients if
they determine that disclosure would impede
“discovery of the truth”, and in cases relating
to national or external security, hindering
the right to adequately prepare a defence.
In August, Parliament’s Judicial and Legal
Commission submitted a bill proposing
postponement of the Code’s planned entry
into force in October, due to the “existence
of serious problems and barriers for [its]
implementation”. Additionally, the bill, in a
regressive move, proposed amendments to
19 articles, which largely aimed to reverse
the improvements made in the new Code
including with regard to access to lawyers.
188
Courts continued to convict defendants
in the absence of defence lawyers or on the
basis of “confessions” or other evidence
obtained through torture or other ill-treatment.
In some cases, the authorities broadcast
detainees’ “confessions” on television
before trial, breaching the presumption
of innocence.
In September, the cabinet passed a Bill
of Attorneyship, drafted by the judiciary,
and submitted it to Parliament for approval.
The draft bill discriminated against non-
Muslims by disqualifying them from
membership of the Board of Directors of the
Iranian Bar Association, and threatened the
independence of the Association.
DISCRIMINATION – ETHNIC AND
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES
President Rouhani’s appointment of a special
adviser on ethnic and religious minorities
did not result in a reduction in the pervasive
discrimination against Iran’s ethnic minority
communities, including Ahwazi Arabs,
Azerbaijanis, Baluchis, Kurds and Turkmen,
or against religious minorities, including Ahl-e
Haq, Baha’is, Christian converts, Sufis and
Sunni Muslims.
Discrimination against ethnic minorities
affected their access to basic services such
as housing, water and sanitation, employment
and education. Ethnic minorities were not
permitted to use their minority language as a
medium of instruction in education and were
denied adequate opportunities to learn it.
Members of ethnic minority groups also
faced a high risk of prosecution on vague
charges such as “enmity against God” and
“corruption on earth”, which could carry
the death penalty. The authorities secretly
executed at least eight Ahwazi Arabs after
they were convicted on charges that included
“enmity against God” after grossly unfair
trials, and refused to hand over their bodies to
their families. By October, the authorities held
at least 33 Sunni men, mostly members of the
Kurdish minority, on death row on charges
of “gathering and colluding against national
Amnesty International Report 2014/15security”, “spreading propaganda against the
system”, “membership of Salafist groups”,
“corruption on Earth” and “enmity against
God”. Converts from Shi’a to Sunni Islam
faced increased persecution. 4
In December, the authorities used threats
of immediate execution and other punitive
measures against 24 Kurdish prisoners who
were on hunger strike in protest against
conditions in Ward 12 of Oroumieh Central
Prison, West Azerbaijan Province, where they
and other political prisoners were held. 5
The authorities subjected Baha’is to further
persecution by closing down their businesses
and destroying their cemeteries. Dozens of
Baha’is remained in prison.
In September, the authorities arrested
over 800 Gonabadi Dervishes at a peaceful
protest held in Tehran in solidarity with nine
imprisoned Gonabadi Dervishes who were
on hunger strike. The hunger strikers had
demanded that the authorities respect the
civil rights of Gonabadi Dervishes and treat
them as equal members of society. 6
Dissident Shi’a clerics and others
who expressed alternatives to the official
interpretation of Shi’a Islam, as well as
atheists, remained at risk of persecution,
including arrest, imprisonment and
possible execution.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women remained subject to widespread
and systematic discrimination in law and
practice. Personal status laws giving women
subordinate status to men in matters such
as marriage, divorce, child custody and
inheritance remained in force.
Two population-related draft bills under
parliamentary consideration threatened
to reduce women’s access to sexual and
reproductive health services, thereby affecting
their rights to life, privacy, gender equality
and the freedom to decide the number
and spacing of their children. One draft bill
aimed to prevent surgical procedures aimed
at permanently preventing pregnancies
by imposing disciplinary measures on
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
health professionals who conducted such
procedures. The other bill sought to reduce
divorces and remove family disputes from
judicial decision-making, hence prioritizing
preservation of families over addressing
domestic violence. Neither law had been
enacted by the end of the year. A proposed
law to afford women protection against
violence made no progress and the authorities
failed to take steps to address violence
against women and girls, including early
and forced marriages, marital rape and
domestic violence.
Women also faced restrictions on
employment. Official statistics from
September showed that the number of
women in employment had fallen by 100,000
annually over the previous eight years. In
August, the Head of the Public Buildings
Office of the Police said that no women
should be employed in coffee shops or
traditional Iranian restaurants except in their
kitchens, out of public view. In July, the
Tehran Municipality reportedly prohibited
its managers from recruiting women to
secretarial and other administrative posts.
Official efforts to create gender-segregated
workplaces intensified.
Authorities had also banned women
musicians from appearing on stage in 13 of
Iran’s 31 provinces by the end of the year.
In June, security authorities arrested women
who participated in a peaceful protest outside
Azadi Stadium, a Tehran sports venue, to
demand equal access by women to sport
stadiums. 7
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
All sexual conduct between unmarried
individuals remained criminalized.
The authorities continued to persecute
individuals on account of their actual or
perceived sexual orientation and gender
identity. The revised Islamic Penal Code
maintained provisions criminalizing all
consensual same-sex sexual conduct
between adults. The Code made such
189conduct subject to punishments ranging from
100 lashes to the death penalty.
Iranian authorities blocked and banned
publication of any material discussing
homosexuality or sexual conduct outside
heterosexual marriages, using the Cyber
Crimes Law’s provisions on “crimes against
chastity” and “sexual perversion”.
Individuals who did not conform to
stereotypical norms of femininity and
masculinity continued to face discrimination
and violence. Transgender individuals were
denied legal gender recognition and were
denied their rights, including to education
and employment, unless they underwent
gender reassignment surgeries. In February,
Iran’s official Football Federation barred
seven women footballers from competition on
grounds of their “gender ambiguity”.
RIGHT TO EDUCATION
The authorities continued to restrict the right
to education, maintaining the exclusion of
hundreds of students from Iran’s universities
because of their peaceful exercise of the right
to freedom of expression or other human
rights, and systematically denying Baha’is
access to higher education. Dozens of other
students and academics, including some
associated with the Baha’i Institute for Higher
Education suppressed by the government
in 2011, remained in prison. Efforts by the
Ministry of Science, Research and Technology
to allow some banned students and academic
staff to return to universities did not result in
concrete measures to end arbitrary exclusions
of students from higher education. 8 Such
attempts were opposed by conservatives
within Parliament.
The gender quota system used by the
authorities to reverse the trend towards
greater participation by women in higher
education remained in place, but saw some
relaxation in the 2013-2014 academic year.
Official policies aimed at keeping women at
home pursuing “traditional” roles as wives
and mothers continued.
190
DEATH PENALTY
Iran retained the death penalty for a wide
range of offences, including vaguely defined
crimes such as “enmity against God”, and
2014 saw the authorities maintain a high rate
of execution. Some executions were carried
out in public.
Under the revised Islamic Penal Code,
courts continued to impose death sentences
for offences that did not meet the threshold
of “most serious crimes” under international
law, and others such as “insulting the Prophet
of Islam”, that should not be considered
crimes. 9
In many cases, courts imposed death
sentences after proceedings that failed to
respect international fair trial standards,
including by accepting as evidence
“confessions” elicited under torture or other
ill-treatment. Detainees were frequently
denied access to lawyers during pre-trial
investigations. 10
Scores of juvenile offenders, including
some sentenced in previous years for crimes
committed under the age of 18, remained
on death row, and others were executed.
Courts sentenced further juvenile offenders
to death. 11 The revised Islamic Penal Code
allowed the execution of juvenile offenders
for qesas (retribution-in-kind) and hodoud
(offences carrying fixed penalties prescribed
by Islamic law) unless it is determined
that the offender did not understand the
nature of the crime or its consequences, or
the offender’s mental capacity is in doubt.
International law prohibits the death penalty
for children under 18.
The revised Islamic Penal Code also
retained the penalty of stoning to death for
the offence of “adultery while married”. At
least one stoning sentence was reported
to have been imposed in Ghaemshahr,
Mazandaran province; no executions by
stoning were reported.

There was a marked deterioration in
human rights as armed conflict intensified
between government security forces and
fighters of the Islamic State (IS, formerly
ISIS) armed group, which gained control
of large parts of central and northern
Iraq. IS fighters committed widespread
war crimes, including ethnic cleansing of
religious and ethnic minorities through
a campaign of mass killings of men and
abduction and sexual and other abuse of
women and girls. Government forces carried
out indiscriminate bombing and shelling in
IS-controlled areas, and government-backed
Shi’a militias abducted and executed scores
of Sunni men in areas under government
control. The conflict caused the deaths of
some 10,000 civilians between January and
October, forcibly displaced almost 2 million
people and created a humanitarian crisis.
This was exacerbated by the continuing
influx of thousands of refugees from Syria,
mostly to Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan
Region. The government continued to hold
thousands of detainees without charge or
trial, many of them in secret detention with
no access to the outside world. Torture and
other ill-treatment in detention remained
rife, and many trials were unfair. Courts
passed many death sentences, mostly
on terrorism charges; more than 1,000
prisoners were on death row, and executions
continued at a high rate.
www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/049/2014/en
BACKGROUND
Armed conflict flared in January between
government security forces and the Islamic
State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) armed
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
191group, a month after the authorities forcibly
dispersed a year-long protest camp set up
by members of the Sunni community in
Ramadi, Anbar province. Government forces
used indiscriminate shelling to regain control
over Fallujah and parts of Ramadi from ISIS,
killing civilians and causing damage to civilian
infrastructure. Anbar province remained in
conflict throughout the year amid allegations
that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had
undermined efforts by tribal leaders to broker
a solution.
The government’s failure to resolve the
crisis, among other factors, left Anbar unable
to stem the rapid military advance of ISIS,
whose fighters seized control of Mosul, Iraq’s
second largest city, in June and then much
of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninevah and Salah
al-Din provinces. This sparked a dramatic
resurgence in sectarian tensions and massive
displacement of communities at risk from
armed attacks by ISIS or government air
strikes. Ethnic and religious minorities were
particularly targeted by ISIS, which forced all
non-Sunni and non-Muslims out of the areas
under its control.
On 30 June, ISIS declared a “caliphate”,
renamed itself Islamic State (IS) under
the leadership of Iraqi-born Abu Baker
al-Baghdadi, and called on Muslims around
the world to declare allegiance to him.
In August, IS fighters seized control of
the Sinjar region, killing and abducting large
numbers of its Yezidi inhabitants who were
unable to flee. Following IS advances and the
public beheading of UK and US nationals in
IS captivity, a US-led international coalition
of 40 countries began air strikes against IS
in August, and increased military support
and training to Iraqi government forces and
Kurdish Peshmerga forces fighting against IS.
Parliamentary elections took place in April
amid violence that saw two members of the
Independent High Electoral Commission and
at least three candidates killed, and attacks
by gunmen on polling stations in Anbar,
Diyala and other predominantly Sunni areas.
Nuri al-Maliki’s State of Law Coalition, mostly
192
Shi’a, won the largest bloc of seats but he
did not secure a third term as Prime Minister
and was replaced in September, following
domestic and foreign demands for a more
inclusive government.
The proposed Ja’fari Law, intended as a
personal status law for Shi’a communities
in Iraq, was withdrawn after widespread
criticism that it could undermine the rights
of women and girls, including by legalizing
marriage for girls as young as nine.
Tension between the Baghdad authorities
and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional
Government (KRG) in the north eased
following an interim agreement in November
over oil revenues and KRG contributions to
the federal budget.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
Government forces and Shi’a militias armed
and backed by the government committed
war crimes and human rights violations,
predominantly targeting Sunni communities.
In Anbar, Mosul and other areas under
IS control, government forces carried out
indiscriminate air strikes in civilian areas,
including with barrel bombs, that killed and
injured civilians. In September, Prime Minister
al-Abadi called on the security forces to cease
all shelling of civilian areas, but air strikes in
IS-controlled areas continued, with ensuing
civilian casualties.
Security forces and Shi’a militias abducted
or detained Sunnis and carried out scores
of extrajudicial executions with impunity. In
areas where they regained control from IS,
they also destroyed homes and businesses
of Sunni residents, in reprisal for the
alleged support for IS by members of those
communities. KRG Peshmerga forces also
carried out reprisal destruction of homes of
Sunni Arab residents in areas they recaptured
from IS.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Armed groups carried out indiscriminate
suicide and car bomb attacks throughout
Iraq, killing and injuring thousands of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15civilians. As they gained control of much of
northwestern Iraq, IS fighters embarked on a
systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing in
which they committed war crimes, including
mass summary killings and abductions that
targeted religious and ethnic minorities,
including Christians, Yezidis, Shi’a Turkmen
and Shi’a Shabaks.
Hundreds of detainees, mainly Shi’a,
were killed by IS fighters who seized
Badush Central Prison, west of Mosul, in
June. In July, IS fighters forced thousands
of Christians from their homes and
communities, threatening them with death
unless they converted to Islam, and in August
carried out deadly mass attacks against the
Yezidi minority. IS fighters who attacked the
Sinjar region abducted thousands of Yezidi
civilians, summarily killing hundreds of men
and boys as young as 12 in Qiniyeh, Kocho
and other villages. Hundreds, possibly
thousands, including entire families remained
missing. Hundreds of women and girls were
subjected to sexual abuse.
IS fighters also killed members of the Sunni
community they suspected of opposing them
or of working for the government, its security
forces or previously for US forces in Iraq.
In October, IS killed over 320 members of
the Sunni Albu Nimr tribe in Anbar as the
government sought to mobilize and arm Sunni
tribes to fight against IS.
IS fighters carried out summary killings of
hundreds of people they captured, including
government soldiers. In June, they summarily
executed more than 1,000 soldiers and
army volunteers taken prisoner as they fled
unarmed from Camp Speicher, a major
military base in Tikrit. IS posted video footage
of some of the killings on the internet.
IS forces destroyed or desecrated historical
sites and places of worship across all ethnic
and religious communities, established
Shari’a courts in areas they controlled and
called for those who had worked for the
government or US forces to repent. They
issued strict rules on individual behaviour,
requiring women and girls to wear face
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
veils and to be with a male relative outside
the home, segregating males and females
at schools and workplaces, and banning
smoking and “western-style” activities
and lifestyles.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Women and girls, mainly from the Yezidi
community, were abducted by IS fighters and
subjected to forced marriage, rape and other
sexual abuses. They were also reportedly
sold as slaves and sexually exploited, both
within Iraq and in IS-controlled areas of
neighbouring Syria. By November, more than
200 women and chidren, some only a few
months old, had managed to escape from
IS captivity. Among them was an 18-year-
old woman who was abducted with other
relatives when IS fighters raided the Sinjar
area in August and forcibly “married” to an
IS fighter who repeatedly raped her and beat
her after she tried to escape. She escaped
together with a girl aged 15 who had also
been abducted and given to an IS fighter as a
“wife”. Other women were victims of unlawful
execution-style killings for criticizing the IS
or disobeying its orders. In October, IS killed
a former parliamentarian, Iman Muhammad
Younes, after holding her in captivity
for weeks.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
The authorities held thousands of detainees
without charge or trial under provisions of the
anti-terrorism law. In February, the head of
the Parliament’s Human Rights Committee
alleged that around 40,000 detainees
remained in prison awaiting investigations.
Many were held in prisons and detention
centres run by various government ministries.
A letter sent by the Central Investigation
Court to the Head of the Supreme Judicial
Council in 2013, published in April 2014,
reported that authorities continued to carry
out unlawful arrests using a list containing
partial names of thousands of suspects that
the Anti-terrorism General Directorate had
sent to police stations in connection with
193sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. This
was believed to have led to the detention of
the wrong people on the basis that part of
their names corresponded to partial names
on the list.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
common and widespread in prisons
and detention centres, particularly those
controlled by the Ministries of the Interior
and Defence, and were committed with
impunity. These centres were blocked
to inspection by the Independent High
Commission for Human Rights. Interrogators
tortured detainees to extract information and
“confessions” for use against them at trial;
sometimes detainees were tortured to death.
Government representatives attending the
Universal Periodic Review of Iraq at the UN
Human Rights Council said the authorities
had investigated 516 torture cases between
2008 and 2014, with many resulting in
prosecutions, but provided no details and did
not identify the security agencies responsible.
’Uday Taha Kurdi, a lawyer and father of
two, died in June after 15 days of detention
by Anti-terrorism General Directorate officials
in Baghdad. In a letter to the Iraqi Lawyers’
Union in July, the Ministry of the Interior
said that ’Uday Taha Kurdi had suffered
a “health problem” in detention and had
been taken to hospital, where he died. The
Ministry also said that a judge had concluded
that ’Uday Taha Kurdi, whose brother was
held on terrorism charges, was “from the
IS leadership” and belonged to “a terrorist
family”, and that he had told the judge, when
asked, that he had not been tortured. The
Supreme Judicial Council said his death
resulted from kidney failure, not torture as
alleged. However, photographs of ’Uday
Taha Kurdi’s body taken at the morgue and
obtained by Amnesty International showed
that he had sustained bruises, open wounds
and burns – consistent with allegations of
torture – prior to his death.

UNFAIR TRIALS
The criminal justice system remained deeply
flawed. The judiciary lacked independence.
Judges and lawyers involved in trials of
members of armed groups continued to be
targets for killings, abductions and assaults
by armed groups. Trials, particularly of
defendants facing terrorism charges, were
frequently unfair; courts returned guilty
verdicts on the basis of torture-tainted
“confessions”, which were often broadcast
on the government-controlled al-Iraqiya TV
channel. Other guilty verdicts were based
on evidence from secret, unidentified
informants, including in cases that resulted in
death sentences.
In November, a Baghdad court sentenced
former leading Sunni parliamentarian Ahmed
al-‘Alwani to death on terrorism-related
charges after a grossly unfair trial. Security
forces had arrested him in December 2013
after they forcibly dispersed a year-long
protest in Anbar.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Journalists worked in extremely hazardous
conditions and faced threats from both state
and non-state actors. Some were victims of
targeted killings or assassination attempts;
others were physically assaulted.
In March, Mohammad Bdaiwi
al-Shammari, a university professor and
Baghdad Bureau Chief for Radio Free Iraq,
was shot dead at a checkpoint in Baghdad
by a Presidential Guards officer during an
argument over access to the presidential
complex. In August, a court sentenced the
officer to life imprisonment.
In June, the government-controlled
Communications and Media Commission
issued “mandatory” guidelines regulating
media activities “during the war on
terror”, demanding that media outlets not
make public information about insurgent
forces, and requiring them to not criticize
government forces and to report on
government forces only in favourable terms.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Journalists were abducted and executed
by IS in areas under their control. In October,
Ra’ad Mohammed Al-‘Azawi, cameraman
for Sama Salah al-Din TV Channel, was
beheaded in Samarra, after a month in
captivity, reportedly for refusing to co-operate
with IS. KRG authorities continued to detain
journalist Niaz Aziz Saleh, held since
January 2012 for allegedly disclosing details
of election rigging, without charge or trial.
General Security (Asayish Gishti) in Erbil
reportedly refused repeatedly to take him to
court to stand trial.
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE DEATH PENALTY
Almost 2 million people were forced from
their homes due to the fighting in the Anbar,
Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninevah and Salah al-Din
provinces, with half of them fleeing to Iraq’s
Kurdistan Region, which by November was
also hosting some 225,000 refugees from
Syria. Thousands of Iraqi refugees returned to
Iraq from Syria and elsewhere but could not
return to their homes, swelling the number of
internally displaced persons.
The unprecedented scale of the
humanitarian crisis in Iraq led the UN
to categorize it at the highest level of
emergency and advised governments
to afford international protection to Iraqi
asylum-seekers and safeguard them from
forcible return. Courts continued to impose death sentences
for a range of crimes. Most of the defendants
had been convicted on terrorism-related
charges, often after unfair trials. In April, the
Justice Ministry said 600 prisoners were on
death row at al-Nassiriya Prison alone, where
new execution facilities were installed. In
August, the Justice Minister said that a total
of 1,724 prisoners were awaiting execution,
including some whose sentences had still to
be finally confirmed.
The authorities continued to carry out large
numbers of executions, including multiple
executions. On 21 January, the authorities
executed 26 prisoners less than a week after
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged
the Iraqi authorities to impose a moratorium
on executions. Rebuffing this call during a
joint press conference with Ban Ki-moon,
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said that
his government did “not believe that the
rights of someone who kills people must
be respected”.
KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ
Although Kurdish Peshmerga forces battled
against IS in several areas of northern Iraq,
the three provinces that comprise the semi-
autonomous Kurdistan Region remained
largely immune from the violence engulfing
much of the rest of Iraq until November,
when a car bomb exploded outside an Erbil
governorate building killing at least four and
injuring 22 others.
The KRG authorities continued to target
those who openly criticized official corruption
or expressed dissent. The executive
authorities continued to interfere in the
judiciary, influencing trials. Incidents of
torture and other ill-treatment continued to
be reported. People arrested on terrorism
charges were held incommunicado
without access to family or lawyers for
prolonged periods.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
IRELAND
Republic of Ireland
Head of state: Michael D. Higgins
Head of government: Enda Kenny
Abortion legislation and guidance failed
to comply with Ireland’s human rights
obligations. Transgender individuals
faced barriers to legal gender recognition.
Responses to victims of past institutional
195abuse fell below adequate standards of
truth, justice and reparations.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
The Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act
(the Act) was enacted in 2013 to respond to
the 2010 European Court of Human Rights
decision in A, B and C v. Ireland, with the
stated aim of ensuring pregnant women’s or
girls’ access to abortion when there is a “real
and substantial risk” to their life as permitted
under the Constitution. Neither the Act nor
related guidance published in September
2014 provided sufficient assistance to
medical professionals in assessing when
a pregnancy posed such a risk to life, or
adequately protected the rights of the
pregnant woman or girl. In December, the
Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers
closed its examination of the implementation
of the A, B and C v. Ireland decision. 1
The Act recriminalized abortion in all other
circumstances, with a potential penalty of 14
years’ imprisonment.
In July, the UN Human Rights Committee
criticized the criminalization of abortion, and
the Act’s requirements of excessive scrutiny
of pregnant and suicidal women or girls
which could lead to further mental distress.
The Committee called on Ireland to revise its
laws, including its Constitution, to provide for
access to abortion in cases of rape, incest,
serious risks to the health of the woman or
girl, and fatal foetal impairment.
DISCRIMINATION
Transgender people
In December the government published a
bill proposing legislative provision for legal
gender recognition. 2 The bill’s proposals fell
short of human rights standards, including by
requiring transgender individuals to dissolve
their marriages or civil partnerships before
applying for legal gender recognition. 3
People with disabilities
Independent registration and inspections
of residential care centres for people with
disabilities began in November 2013. In
196
December 2014, a current affairs television
programme revealed secretly recorded
evidence of abusive treatment, and denial of
basic rights and autonomy, of three people
in one centre, raising wider concerns about
other centres.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
There were continuing delays in the
determination of individuals’ asylum or
other protection needs, with many people
remaining for years in ”direct provision”
accommodation unsuitable for long-stay
residence, especially for families, children
and victims of torture.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AND CHILDREN
In February 2013, the government published
a report purporting to clarify the state’s
interaction with the religious-run “Magdalene
Laundries”. The report and the ex gratia
compensation scheme announced thereafter
fell below adequate standards of truth, justice
and reparations. 4
In June, following international outcry at
allegations of past abuses of women and
children in so-called ”mother and baby
homes”, operated by religious orders with
state funding between the 1920s and 1990s,
the government committed to establishing an
independent Commission of Investigation. 5
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In July legislation was enacted creating the
Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission
as the new National Human Rights Institution
(NHRI), the result of a merger between the
Irish Human Rights Commission (the former
NHRI) and Ireland’s equality body. The
legislation contained two definitions of human
rights, limiting the new NHRI’s enforcement
and powers to a narrow definition which
excluded the majority of economic, social and
cultural rights.
The government-appointed Constitutional
Convention recommended several
Amnesty International Report 2014/15amendments to the Constitution, including
providing for equal access to civil marriage for
same-sex couples and removing the offence
of blasphemy; the government accepted both
recommendations and committed to putting
them to referendum in 2015. In February,
the Convention recommended constitutional
incorporation of economic, social and
cultural rights.
Ireland ratified the Optional Protocol to the
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on
a communications procedure in September.
In December, the government requested
that the European Court of Human Rights
review its 1978 judgment in Ireland v. United
Kingdom, a landmark case concerning the
torture and ill-treatment of 14 Irish nationals
held by UK authorities under internment
powers in Northern Ireland during 1971-72
(see UK entry). 6

ISRAEL AND
THE OCCUPIED
PALESTINIAN
TERRITORIES
State of Israel
Head of state: Reuven Rivlin (replaced Shimon
Peres in July)
Head of government: Benjamin Netanyahu
Israeli forces committed war crimes and
human rights violations during a 50-day
military offensive in the Gaza Strip that
killed over 1,500 civilians, including
539 children, wounded thousands more
civilians, and caused massive civilian
displacement and destruction of property
and vital services. Israel maintained its air,
sea and land blockade of Gaza, imposing
collective punishment on its approximately
1.8 million inhabitants and stoking the
humanitarian crisis. In the West Bank,
Israeli forces carried out unlawful killings of
Palestinian protesters, including children,
and maintained an array of oppressive
restrictions on Palestinians’ freedom of
movement while continuing to promote
illegal settlements and allow Israeli settlers
to attack Palestinians and destroy their
property with near total impunity. Israeli
forces detained thousands of Palestinians,
some of whom reported being tortured, and
held around 500 administrative detainees
without trial. Within Israel, the authorities
continued to demolish homes of Palestinian
Bedouin in “unrecognized villages” in the
Negev/Naqab region and commit forcible
evictions. They also detained and summarily
expelled thousands of foreign migrants,
including asylum-seekers, and imprisoned
Israeli conscientious objectors.
197BACKGROUND
Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians
mounted rapidly amid the collapse of
US-sponsored negotiations in April, a
Fatah-Hamas reconciliation agreement,
and Israel’s continuing illegal settlement
expansion in the West Bank and blockade
of Gaza. The tensions flared into renewed
armed conflict in July following the killing
of at least 15 Palestinians by Israeli forces
since the beginning of the year, the abduction
and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the
West Bank by Palestinian men affiliated to
Hamas, the reprisal killing of a Palestinian
youth by Israelis, and rocket-firing from Gaza
into Israel. The Israeli military launched an
offensive, Operation Protective Edge, on 8
July against the Gaza Strip while Hamas and
other Palestinian armed groups increased
rocket firing into southern Israel. After 10
days of air strikes, Israel launched a ground
invasion in Gaza, withdrawing shortly before a
US and Egypt-brokered ceasefire took effect
after 50 days of hostilities.
The ceasefire brought an end to open
conflict but tension remained acute,
particularly in the West Bank. Community
relations were inflamed by a series of attacks
by Palestinians targeting Israeli civilians,
including one on worshippers in a synagogue;
new killings of Palestinians, including
protesters, by Israeli forces; the government’s
announcement of new land expropriations
and plans to build additional housing units
for settlers in East Jerusalem; and the
Israeli authorities’ decision in November
to temporarily close access to Jerusalem’s
Temple Mount, preventing worshippers from
reaching the Al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam’s
holiest sites. Growing international recognition
of Palestine as a state also contributed
to tensions.
In December , Prime Minister Netanyahu
dismissed two ministers for reasons including
disagreements on a proposed “Nation-State
Bill” defining Israel as a state for the Jewish
people. The Knesset voted for dissolution and
198
the holding of new elections in March 2015,
upon the Prime Minister’s initiative.
ARMED CONFLICT
Israel’s Protective Edge military offensive,
which Israel said it launched in response
to an upsurge in rocket firing into Israel by
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, killed more
than 2,000 inhabitants of Gaza, including
more than 1,500 civilians, among them some
539 children. Israeli air and ground attacks
damaged or destroyed thousands of civilian
homes and internally displaced around
110,000 Palestinians, as well as severing
power generation and water supplies, and
damaging other civil infrastructure. In Israel,
indiscriminate rockets and other weapons
fired by Palestinian armed groups from Gaza
in breach of the laws of war killed six civilians,
including one child, injured dozens and
damaged civilian property.
During the 50 days of conflict before a
ceasefire took effect on 26 August, Israeli
forces committed war crimes, including
disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks
on Gaza’s densely populated civilian areas as
well as targeted attacks on schools sheltering
civilians and other civilian buildings that the
Israeli forces claimed were used by Hamas as
command centres or to store or fire rockets.
On the night of 30 July, Israeli artillery fire hit
the Jabaliya elementary school where more
than 3,000 civilians had taken refuge, killing
at least 20 and injuring others. It was the sixth
time a school being used by the UN to shelter
civilians had been attacked since the conflict
began three weeks earlier.
Israeli forces also attacked hospitals and
medical workers, including ambulance staff
seeking to assist the wounded or retrieve the
bodies of those killed. Dozens of homes were
destroyed or damaged by missiles or aerial
bombs with families still inside. For example,
in eight cases documented by Amnesty
International, Israeli strikes on inhabited
houses killed at least 104 civilians, including
62 children. Often the Israeli military gave no
reason for specific attacks.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In the days immediately leading up to the
ceasefire, Israeli forces launched attacks
that destroyed three multistorey residential
buildings in Gaza City and a modern
commercial centre in Rafah, amid vague
assertions that the residential buildings
housed a Hamas command centre and
“facilities linked to Palestinian militants” but
without providing any compelling evidence
or explanation why, if there were legitimate
military reasons to justify the attacks, less
destructive means were not selected.
Israeli authorities sought publicly to
shift the blame for the large loss of life and
wholesale destruction caused by the Israeli
offensive in Gaza onto Hamas and Palestinian
armed groups on the grounds that they fired
rockets and other weapons from within or
near civilian residential areas and concealed
munitions in civilian buildings.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT –
GAZA BLOCKADE AND WEST
BANK RESTRICTIONS
Israeli forces maintained their land, sea and
air blockade of Gaza throughout the year,
effectively imposing collective punishment
on the territory’s approximately 1.8 million,
predominantly civilian, inhabitants, with all
imports and exports, and any movements
of people into or out of Gaza, subject to
Israeli approval; Egypt’s continued closure
of its Rafah border crossing kept Gaza
effectively sealed. The already severe
humanitarian consequences of the blockade,
in force continuously since June 2007,
were evidenced by the sizeable proportion
of Gaza’s population that depended on
international humanitarian aid for their
survival, and were greatly exacerbated by
the devastation and population displacement
caused during Israel’s Operation
Protective Edge.
Israeli forces policed the blockade using
live fire against Palestinians who entered or
approached a 500m-wide buffer zone that
they imposed inside Gaza’s land border with
Israel, and against fishermen who entered
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
or approached the “exclusion zone” that
Israel maintains along the full length of
Gaza’s coast. Israeli forces shot dead seven
Palestinian civilians in or near the buffer
zone before Operation Protective Edge, and
another after the ceasefire, when the buffer
zone was to be reduced and the permitted
fishing zone extended. Shooting incidents
remained frequent; some fishermen were also
shot and wounded by Israeli navy forces.
In the West Bank, Israel continued its
construction of the wall/fence with attached
guard towers, mostly on Palestinian land,
routing it to afford protection to illegal
settlements while cutting off Palestinian
villagers from their lands. Palestinian farmers
were required to obtain special permits to
access their lands between the wall and the
Green Line demarcating the West Bank’s
border with Israel. Throughout the West Bank,
Israeli forces maintained other restrictions on
the free movement of Palestinians by using
military checkpoints and restricting access
to certain areas by preventing Palestinians
using bypass roads constructed for the use
of Israeli settlers. These restrictions hindered
Palestinians’ access to hospitals, schools
and workplaces. Furthermore, Israel forcibly
transferred Palestinians out of occupied East
Jerusalem to other areas in the West Bank.
Restrictions were tightened further
during Operation Brother’s Keeper, the
Israeli authorities’ crackdown following the
abduction of three Israeli teenage hitchhikers
in the West Bank in June. Operation Brother’s
Keeper saw a heightened Israeli military
presence in Palestinian towns and villages,
the killing of at least five Palestinians, mass
arrests and detentions, the imposition of
arbitrary travel restrictions and raids on
Palestinian homes.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Israeli soldiers and border guards unlawfully
killed at least 50 Palestinian civilians in the
West Bank and continued to use excessive
force, including live fire, during protests
against Israel’s continued military occupation,
199when arresting political activists and during
Israel’s 50-day military offensive against
Gaza. Some killings may have amounted
to extrajudicial executions. In September,
the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs reported that the
number of Palestinians wounded by Israeli
forces in the West Bank – more than 4,200
since the start of 2014 – already exceeded
the 2013 total, and that many of those
wounded, including children, had been
hit by rubber-coated metal bullets fired by
Israeli forces. As in previous years, soldiers
and border guards used live fire against
protesters, including those who threw stones
and other projectiles, who posed no serious
threat to their lives.
IMPUNITY
The authorities failed to conduct independent
investigations into alleged war crimes and
human rights violations committed by Israeli
forces during Operation Protective Edge and
refused to co-operate with an international
investigation appointed by the UN Human
Rights Council. However, they apparently
co-operated with the UN Secretary-General’s
Board of Inquiry, established to look into
incidents relating to UN buildings in Gaza.
In August, the military’s Chief of General
Staff ordered an inquiry into more than 90
“exceptional incidents” during Operation
Protective Edge where there was “reasonable
ground for suspicion of a violation of the
law”. In September, it was announced that
the Military Advocate General had closed
investigations into nine cases and ordered
criminal investigations into 10 others.
Authorities also failed to carry out adequate
investigations into shootings of Palestinians
during protests in the West Bank despite
compelling evidence that Israeli forces
repeatedly used excessive force and resorted
to live fire in circumstances where such lethal
means were unwarranted.
200
DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL
Hundreds of Palestinians from the Occupied
Palestinian Territories were held without
charge or trial under administrative detention
orders issued against them on the basis of
secret information to which they and their
lawyers had no access, and were unable
to effectively challenge. The number of
administrative detainees more than doubled
following the security forces’ round-up of
Palestinians after the abduction and killing
of three Israeli teenagers in June, rising from
nearly 200 in May to 468 in September.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Palestinian detainees continued to be tortured
and otherwise ill-treated by Israeli security
officials, particularly Internal Security Agency
officials, who frequently held detainees
incommunicado during interrogation for
days and sometimes weeks. Methods used
included physical assault such as slapping
and throttling, prolonged shackling and
stress positions, sleep deprivation, and
threats against the detainee and their family.
Reports of torture increased amid the wave of
arrests that followed the abduction of Israeli
teenagers in June.
The authorities failed to take adequate
steps either to prevent torture or to conduct
independent investigations when detainees
alleged torture, fuelling a climate of impunity.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED
EVICTIONS AND DEMOLITIONS
In the West Bank, Israeli forces continued
to demolish Palestinian homes and other
structures, forcibly evicting hundreds
from their homes often without warning or
prior consultation. Families of Palestinians
who had carried out attacks on Israelis
also faced demolition of their homes as a
punitive measure.
Palestinian Bedouin citizens of Israel living
in “unrecognized” and newly recognized
villages also faced destruction of homes
and structures because the authorities said
that they had been built without permission.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Israeli authorities prohibited all construction
without official permits, which were denied
to Arab inhabitants of the villages, while
also denying them access to basic services
such as electricity and piped water supplies.
Under the 2011 Prawer Plan, the authorities
proposed to demolish 35 “unrecognized”
villages and forcibly displace up to 70,000
Bedouin inhabitants from their current lands
and homes, and relocate them to officially
designated sites. Implementation of the plan,
which was adopted without consultation
with the affected Bedouin communities,
remained stalled following the resignation in
December 2013 of the government minister
overseeing it. Official statements announced
its cancellation, but the army continued to
demolish homes and other structures.
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
Military tribunals continued to impose prison
sentences on Israeli citizens who refused
to undertake compulsory military service
on grounds of conscience. At least six
conscientious objectors were imprisoned
during the year. Omar Sa’ad was released
in June after serving 150 days in a military
prison and then declared unsuitable and
exempted from military service.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Asylum-seekers in need of international
protection were denied access to a fair
determination process. Authorities held
more than 2,000 African asylum-seekers in
indefinite detention in a facility in the Negev/
Naqab desert.
The authorities held more than 2,200
Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers at
Holot, a desert detention facility opened after
the government rushed through Amendment
4 of the Prevention of Infiltration Law in
2013. In September, the High Court of
Justice struck down Amendment 4, under
which the authorities had taken powers to
automatically detain all newly arrived asylum-
seekers for one year, ruling that it infringed
the right to human dignity. The Court
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
ordered the government to close the Holot
facility or establish an alternative legislative
arrangement within 90 days. In December,
the Knesset passed new amendments to
the law that would allow the authorities to
continue automatic detention of asylum-
seekers.
Eritrean and Sudanese nationals, who
made up more than 90% of an estimated
47,000 African asylum-seekers in Israel,
continued in practice to be denied access
to fair refugee determination procedures. By
the end of the year, Israeli authorities had
extended refugee status to just two Eritreans
and no Sudanese, dismissing many other
claims without due consideration. Asylum-
seekers were prohibited by law from taking
paid work and had little or no access to health
care and welfare services. Meanwhile, the
authorities pressured many to leave Israel
“voluntarily” under a process that paid them
to withdraw their asylum claims and return
to their home countries or travel to third
countries. More than 5,000 Eritrean and
Sudanese nationals were reported to have
accepted “voluntary return” in the first 10
months of the year, some leaving after facing
imminent risk of detention, despite fears
that they faced persecution or torture in the
countries from which they had fled. Some
were reported to have been detained when
they returned to Sudan and accused of spying
for Israel.
Israel allegedly maintained secret
agreements with certain African
countries allowing for the transfer of asylum-
seekers under conditions which denied them
access to a fair refugee determination process
in Israel or any protection from possible
subsequent transfers to their home countries,
including in cases where such returns
amounted to refoulement.
201ITALY
Republic of Italy
Head of state: Giorgio Napolitano
Head of government: Matteo Renzi
Over 170,000 refugees and migrants
trying to reach Italy from North Africa on
unseaworthy vessels were rescued at sea
by Italian authorities. The government’s
decision to stop a dedicated operation to
save lives at sea, Mare Nostrum, at the
end of October raised concerns that the
death toll could increase significantly.
The authorities failed to ensure adequate
reception conditions for the high number
of seaborne refugees and migrants.
Discrimination against Roma continued,
with thousands segregated in camps. Italy
failed to introduce the crime of torture
into domestic legislation and to establish
an independent national human rights
institution.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Over 170,000 refugees and migrants arrived
in Italy by sea, including more than 10,000
unaccompanied children, the vast majority
having departed from Libya. 156,362 had
been rescued through Operation Mare
Nostrum (OMN) by the end of October.
A further 13,668 people were rescued
by Italian authorities in November and
December. Despite these unilateral efforts,
over 3,400 refugees and migrants were
believed to have drowned attempting to
cross the Mediterranean. On 31 October,
the government announced OMN’s end, to
coincide with the start on 1 November of the
smaller, border control-focused Operation
Triton by Frontex, the EU border management
agency. NGOs expressed concern that this
would place people’s lives at risk. 1
The authorities struggled to ensure
adequate reception conditions for the tens
of thousands of refugees and migrants who
202
disembarked in Sicily and other southern
ports, including traumatized shipwreck
survivors, and to adequately protect
thousands of unaccompanied children.
There was no progress in investigating the
circumstances of the deaths of some 200
people who drowned when a trawler carrying
over 400 mostly Syrian refugees and migrants
sank on 11 October 2013. There was concern
that failures by Maltese and Italian authorities
might have delayed their rescue.
In October, in the case of Sharifi and
Others v. Italy and Greece, the European
Court of Human Rights found that Italy
had violated the prohibition of collective
expulsions and exposed four Afghan
nationals, who had arrived irregularly, to the
risk of ill-treatment and other violations by
returning them to Greece, as well as to the
further risk of torture and death in case of
deportation to Afghanistan.
Refugees and asylum-seekers, including
children, remained at risk of destitution.
In April, the Parliament passed legislation
requiring the government to abolish the
crime of “irregular entry and stay” within 18
months. Irregular migrants re-entering the
country following an expulsion would still face
criminal sanctions. However, “irregular entry
and stay” remained a crime at the end of
the year.
In September, the Ministry of the Interior
authorized police to use force to ensure
the collection of fingerprints during the
identification of refugees and migrants.
This was immediately followed by reports
of excessive use of force in the course of
identification procedures.
In October, legislation was adopted
reducing the maximum period of detention
for irregular migrants pending deportation
from 18 months to 90 days. Conditions
in detention centres for irregular migrants
remained inadequate.
Migrant workers continued to be exploited
and remained vulnerable to abuse and were
often unable to access justice.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Thousands of Roma families continued to live
in poor conditions in segregated camps and
centres, including more than 4,000 in Rome
alone. The government failed to implement
the National Strategy for the Inclusion of
Roma, especially with regard to adequate
housing. Several forced evictions of Roma
were reported across the country.
A European Commission inquiry into
possible breaches by Italy of the EU Race
Equality Directive in relation to access by
Roma to adequate housing was ongoing.
Roma families transferred from the
authorized camp of Cesarina in Rome
in December 2013, to allow for its
refurbishment, continued to live in inadequate
conditions in a Roma-only reception facility.
Rome municipal authorities stated they would
return the families to the camp once works
were completed. No alternative adequate
housing options were made available.
Roma remained excluded from accessing
social housing. Rome housing authorities
did not withdraw a January 2013 circular
discriminating against Roma families living
in authorized camps in the allocation of
social housing. However, in June, in the
context of the inquiry regarding the EU Race
Equality Directive, they stated that they
intended to apply the circular in a non-
discriminatory manner.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The Italian Constitutional Court ruled in
February that the government enjoyed
absolute discretion to invoke the “state
secrets” doctrine in national security-related
cases. The Court of Cassation, Italy’s highest
court, affirmed the Constitutional Court ruling
and annulled the convictions of high-level
Italian intelligence officials, convicted in
relation to the abduction of Usama Mostafa
Hassan Nasr (known as Abu Omar) from a
Milan street in 2003. Following his abduction,
Abu Omar had been handed over to the
US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and
rendered to Egypt, where he was tortured.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In March, the Court of Cassation upheld
the convictions of three CIA officials, including
former Rome CIA chief Jeff Castelli and
former Milan CIA chief Robert Seldon Lady,
for the abduction of Abu Omar. The Court
ruled that the CIA operatives were not covered
by diplomatic immunity. In total, 26 US
nationals had been convicted in their absence
in the Abu Omar case.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Attempts to incorporate the crime of torture
into national legislation failed again, a 25-year
breach of Italy’s obligations under the UN
Convention against Torture.
In November, the Court of Cassation
annulled the conviction for perjury against
Francesco Colucci, who was head of police
in Genoa when scores of protesters were
tortured and otherwise ill-treated during the
2001 G8 summit meeting. Francesco Colucci
had been convicted of perjury for trying to
shelter from accountability the then national
head of police, Gianni De Gennaro, and a
senior official of the police special operations
branch of Genoa. The statute of limitation for
the offence expired in December rendering a
retrial impossible.
Overcrowding and poor conditions
remained common throughout the prison
system. Legislation to reduce the length of
prison sentences for certain offences and to
increase the use of non-custodial sentences
was adopted in August 2013 and February
2014 to ease overcrowding. A national
ombudsperson for the rights of detainees was
also created. The measures followed a 2013
European Court ruling that Italy had violated
the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment by subjecting
detainees to excessively harsh conditions
due to overcrowded cells and insufficient
living space.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
Despite progress in a few cases, concerns
remained about the lack of accountability
for deaths in custody as a result of flawed
203investigations and shortcomings in judicial
proceedings.
In April, the Perugia court of appeal upheld
the conviction of a prison officer for falsifying
documents and failing to assist Aldo Bianzino,
who died in a Perugia prison two days after
his arrest in 2007. The ruling confirmed that
there were failings in the initial investigation.
In July, in the case of Giuseppe Uva, who
died at a hospital in Varese shortly after being
stopped by police in 2008, a trial started
against seven police officers for manslaughter,
unlawful arrest and abuse of authority. In
October 2013, a judge had refused the
prosecutor’s request to close the case and
had ordered a fresh investigation. Forensic
examinations in December 2011 revealed
that Giuseppe Uva may have been raped and
otherwise ill-treated.
In October, the Rome court of appeal
acquitted the doctors, nurses and police
officers charged with manslaughter in the
case of Stefano Cucchi, who died a week
after his arrest in the prison wing of a Rome
hospital in 2009. Forensic evidence was
inconclusive. Stefano Cucchi's family was
concerned that signs of ill-treatment had
been downplayed.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
Italy failed again to establish a national
human rights institution in accordance
with the Principles relating to the Status of
National Institutions (Paris Principles), despite
having repeatedly committed to doing so.

JAMAICA
Jamaica
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Patrick Linton Allen
Head of government: Portia Simpson Miller
Police brutality remained a concern. Attacks
and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people
continued. Steps were taken to deal with
the issue of impunity. Jamaica retained the
death penalty.
BACKGROUND
Levels of homicide remained high, mainly
in marginalized inner-city communities,
although there was a decrease on 2013
figures. The Jamaica Constabulary Force
reported that 699 people had been killed
up to 14 September, 15% fewer than in the
corresponding period for 2013.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Following rising numbers in police killings in
recent years (210 in 2011, 219 in 2012 and
258 in 2013), 2014 saw a reduction in the
number of police killings according to the
Independent Commission of Investigations
(INDECOM), an independent police oversight
agency. By the end of October, 103 civilians
had been killed by police, compared with
220 for the same period in 2013. A number
of people were killed in circumstances
suggesting that they may have been
extrajudicially executed.
Following the death of Mario Deane in
suspicious circumstances in police custody
in August, in September the Ministers of
Justice and National Security announced a
review of the detention system in order to
“develop a strategic response to the issue
of the treatment of persons in lock-ups and
correctional facilities”.
The Criminal Justice (Suppression of
Criminal Organizations) Act, which is aimed
Amnesty International Report 2014/15at “disruption and suppression of criminal
organizations” became law in April. Concerns
were raised that this law could be used to
criminalize whole communities by association.
In February a Commission of Enquiry was
finally established into the state of emergency
of May 2010, when 76 civilians were killed
during an operation by the security forces.
The three-person Commission began its
work on 1 December. In April the Office of
the Public Defender handed over all files
pertaining to its investigations into the state
of emergency to INDECOM. The files include
the cases of 44 people alleged to have been
unlawfully killed by the security forces.
Eleven police officers from Clarendon
suspected of being part of a “death squad”
were arrested and charged in April by
INDECOM. They were alleged to have been
involved in the murder of nine civilians since
2009. Investigations were ongoing at the end
of the year.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
Overburdened courts led to continued
delays in the justice system. In February,
the National Security Minister stated there
was a backlog of approximately 40,000
cases. In June, the Chief Justice said that
the unavailability of forensic evidence,
outstanding statements and ballistic
reports, as well as an absence of adequate
court infrastructure, human and financial
resources, were seriously hampering the
justice system.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Sexual violence against women and girls
remained a concern. Police statistics from the
2013 Economic and Social Survey published
in April 2014 by the Planning Institute of
Jamaica showed that 814 cases of rape were
recorded in 2013, and that 128 women were
murdered in 2013.
A review of the draft National Strategic
Action Plan to Eliminate Gender-Based
Violence, announced in September 2013, was
still ongoing at the end of 2014.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Following a Senate motion in October 2013
calling for greater legislative protection for
women and girls, a joint select committee
of Parliament was finally established in July
2014 to review the Sexual Offences Act,
Offences against the Person Act, Domestic
Violence Act, and the Child Care and
Protection Act, with the objective of improving
protection for women, children, persons living
with disabilities and the elderly from violence
and abuse.
CHILDREN’S RIGHTS
Children continued to be kept in police cells
alongside adults, in some cases for several
days, in contravention of the Child Care and
Protection Act and international law.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Consensual sex between men remained
criminalized. LGBTI organizations continued
to report attacks, harassment and threats
against individuals based on their real or
perceived sexual orientation, which were not
fully and promptly investigated.
On 14 June a mob attacked a young man
at a shopping mall in the town of May Pen
because he was allegedly seen putting on
lipstick. There was no police investigation into
the incident.
In August, Javed Jaghai, a member of
the Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals
and Gays, discontinued the constitutional
challenge he had filed in February 2013
against laws criminalizing sex between men,
following the receipt of threats against him
and his family.
A “conscience vote” by MPs on legislation
criminalizing consensual same-sex relations,
which the government announced would be
held before April, did not take place.
205JAPAN to discrimination, hostility or violence, in line
with international standards. 1
Japan
Head of government: Shinzo Abe JUSTICE SYSTEM
Japan continued to move away from
international human rights standards. The
government failed to effectively address
discrimination against foreign nationals and
their descendants living in Japan, such as
ethnic Koreans. It also failed to refute and
combat attempts to deny Japan's military
sexual slavery system during World War
II. The number of recognized refugees
remained very small. It was feared that
the Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets which came into force
in December could negatively impact
transparency.
DISCRIMINATION
The government failed to speak out
against discriminatory rhetoric, or curb
the use of racially pejorative terms and
harassments against ethnic Koreans and their
descendants, who are commonly referred
to as Zainichi (literally "residing in Japan").
Public demonstrations were held in towns
with a high proportion of Korean residents.
In December, the Supreme Court ruled to
ban the high-profile group “Zainichi Tokken
wo Yurusanai Shimin no Kai” from using
discriminatory and intimidating language
while demonstrating near an ethnic Korean
elementary school located in Kyoto. This
decision marked the first time that the issue
was treated as one of racial discrimination,
based on the definition in the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Racial Discrimination, rather than coming
under other criminal offences such as
defamation or damage of property. However,
by the end of the year the government
had still not passed legislation prohibiting
advocacy of hatred that constitutes incitement
206
The daiyo kangoku system, which allows
police to detain suspects for up to 23 days
prior to charge, continued to facilitate
torture and other ill-treatment to extract
confessions during interrogation. Despite
recommendations from international bodies,
no steps were taken to abolish or reform the
system in line with international standards.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
The government attempted to back away
from the landmark apology – known as the
Kono Statement – it had made two decades
earlier to the survivors of the military sexual
slavery system, in which it had acknowledged
responsibility and apologized to the survivors.
In June the results were made public of a
government-appointed study group which
re-examined the drafting process of the Kono
Statement. Although previous discussions
and decisions were respected, the review
itself increased tensions with neighbouring
countries such as the Republic of Korea, as it
was seen as an attempt to deny governmental
responsibility. Several high-profile public
figures made statements to deny or justify the
system. The government continued to refuse
to officially use the term “sexual slavery”,
and to deny full and effective reparation
to survivors.
DEATH PENALTY
Executions continued to be carried out. In
March a district court ordered a retrial and
the immediate release of Hakamada Iwao.
Hakamada had been sentenced to death
in 1968 after an unfair trial on the basis of
a forced confession, and was the longest-
serving death row inmate in the world. He
suffers from mental illness due to more than
four decades of detention mainly in solitary
confinement. The Prosecutor’s appeal against
a retrial was being examined at the Tokyo
High Court.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
An estimated 4,500 individuals applied for
asylum in Japan but the numbers of refugees
recognized under the UN Refugee Convention
remained very small. A steady increase in the
number of applications has occurred since
2006. Applicants from Myanmar decreased
and there was an increase in applicants from
countries such as Ghana and Cameroon.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The Act on the Protection of Specially
Designated Secrets came into force in
December 2014. This would allow the
government to classify information as
“Specially Designated Secrets (SDS)” when a
“leak can cause a serious obstacle to national
security” in the categories of defence,
diplomacy and so-called “harmful activities”
and “terrorism”. The law could restrict
transparency by limiting access to information
held by public authorities, as the definition
of SDS was vague and the monitoring body
lacked binding powers.

JORDAN
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Head of state: King Abdullah II bin al-Hussein
Head of government: Abdullah Ensour
The authorities maintained strict controls
on the rights to freedom of expression,
association and assembly. Government
critics faced arbitrary arrest and detention;
some were prosecuted and jailed. The
government amended the 2006 Anti-
Terrorism law to encompass acts deemed
disruptive to Jordan’s foreign relations
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
and the dissemination of ideas deemed
supportive of terrorism. The State Security
Court (SSC) continued to try people accused
under anti-terrorism legislation; some
of the accused alleged torture or other
ill-treatment. Jordan continued to receive
and host thousands of refugees from Syria
and, increasingly, Iraq, but barred entry
to Palestinians from Syria. Women faced
discrimination in law and in practice; at
least 14 people were victims of so-called
“honour killings”. Eleven prisoners were
executed in December, the first executions
since 2006.
BACKGROUND
Jordan felt the impact of events beyond its
borders, notably the armed conflicts in Syria
and Iraq, and Israel’s military offensive in
Gaza. The Syrian conflict generated further
refugee flows into Jordan. Jordan hosted over
600,000 refugees from Syria, according to
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and 30,000
refugees from Iraq. Demonstrations in March
over the killing of a Jordanian judge by Israeli
forces at the Allenby Bridge crossing between
Jordan and the West Bank were followed by
mass protests in July and August against
Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza.
Conditions were tense along the border
with Syria and the government tightened
controls there and along the border with
Iraq. In April, the government said Jordanian
warplanes had fired on members of Syrian
armed groups seeking to cross into Jordan.
In June, the USA agreed to send missiles and
military aircraft to Jordan, and in September,
Jordan joined the US-led international alliance
against the Islamic State armed group.
The government made little progress in
implementing promised political reforms but
the King gained sole authority to appoint the
heads of the armed forces and the General
Intelligence Department (GID) under a
constitutional amendment.
207FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
The government maintained strict controls
on freedom of expression, using provisions
criminalizing defamation of the monarchy
and other institutions and religion, the Press
and Publications Law, and the 2010 Law
on Information System Crimes, which gave
the authorities wide powers to censor print,
broadcast and online media. The authorities
blocked some news websites.
In early 2014, the jurisdiction of the
State Security Court (SSC) was restricted to
five crimes: treason, espionage, terrorism,
drugs offences, and money counterfeiting.
However, amendments to the Anti-Terrorism
Law enacted in May imposed new curbs
on freedom of expression by equating acts
deemed to disrupt Jordan’s foreign relations,
including criticism of foreign leaders, and the
dissemination of certain ideas, with terrorism.
The authorities continued to detain and
prosecute political opposition activists, online
critics and journalists, including members of
the banned Hizb ut-Tahrir party, at least 18
of whom faced trial before the SSC, despite
its poor record of upholding international
fair trial standards. In March, Nayef Lafi and
Ibrahim al-Kharabsheh were arrested as they
lobbied parliament against amendments
to the Anti-Terrorism Law, and faced up to
seven years’ imprisonment on charges of
“illegal actions” threatening the government,
and membership of a banned organization.
Wassim Abu Ayesh was tried by the SSC on
terrorism charges. He was accused of posting
an Islamic State group video on Facebook,
which he claimed was in fact a film about
the abuse of detainees in Iraq, and said that
his interrogators made him sign a statement
without allowing him to read it.
In July, security forces attacked and
assaulted journalists at an anti-Israel
protest in Amman. In August, they arrested
Abdulhadi Raji Majali, an Al Ra’i newspaper
journalist, by order of Amman prosecutors for
an online post to which the authorities took
208
offence. He was released on bail one week
later awaiting trial.
Also in July, the SSC imposed three-month
prison terms on three peaceful pro-reform
activists, Mahdi al-Saafin, Ayham Mohamed
Alseem and Fadi Masamra, on charges of
“undermining” the state and “insulting”
the King.
Mohamed Said Bakr and Adel Awad, senior
Muslim Brotherhood members, were brought
to trial before the SSC following their arrest
in September, accused of threatening state
security in public statements that criticized
Jordan’s leaders and links with the USA. In
December, the case against Adel Awad was
thrown out due to lack of evidence.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained a
significant concern. Among those alleging
such abuses were detainees arrested on
suspicion of supporting or fighting for armed
groups, such as Jabhat al-Nusra, in Syria.
In June, the SSC acquitted Abu Qatada
of terrorism charges. UK authorities had
deported him to Jordan in 2013 after
negotiating diplomatic assurances allegedly
to ensure that “confessions” gained from
others through torture would be inadmissible
in a new criminal trial. In reaching its verdict
the SSC did not disregard the “confession”
evidence, considering it a matter of record,
but concluded that it was not supported
by other evidence. In September, the SCC
acquitted Abu Qatada on separate charges
and ordered his release.
ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION
Provincial authorities held hundreds,
possibly thousands, of criminal suspects
in administrative detention without charge
or trial using the Law on Crime Prevention,
in force since 1954. The law empowers
provincial governors to authorize the arrests
and indefinite detention of those they deem
a “danger to society” and affords those
detained no means of appeal or legal remedy.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Jordan hosted over 600,000 refugees
from Syria, about one third of whom were
accommodated in six camps, the largest of
which had a population of over 100,000.
The majority of refugees lived in towns and
cities throughout Jordan. While in principle
maintaining an open-border policy to refugees
from Syria, the authorities closed the border
to Syrian refugees on a number of occasions
and prevented the entry into Jordan of
Palestinians and Iraqis fleeing the Syrian
conflict. The presence of so many refugees
was a huge economic strain and placed a
burden on Jordan’s resources, including
water, education and health care. Insecurity
increased due to the potential for the conflict
to spread into Jordan.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women remained subject to discrimination
in law and practice, and were inadequately
protected from sexual and other violence,
including so-called honour crimes. Tens of
thousands of women married to foreigners
continued to be denied the right to pass on
their nationality to their spouses and children.
In November, the government afforded them
greater access to education and medical care,
but failed to end discrimination. The Ministry
of Justice was also reportedly considering
Penal Code changes to protect women
against sexual harassment.
At least 12 women and two children, a
girl and a boy, were victims of so-called
honour killings. In at least two cases courts
immediately commuted the death sentences
imposed on perpetrators of such killings
to 10-year prison terms, apparently under
a provision allowing courts to commute
or reduce sentences if the victim's family
requests leniency.
In July, UNICEF, the UN children’s agency,
reported an increase in early marriage among
Syrian refugees, noting the associated risks
this posed to girls. The legal age of marriage
for women in Jordan was 18 unless special
dispensation for an earlier marriage was
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
obtained from a judge. Jordanian NGO
Sisterhood is Global reported that 13.2%
of registered marriages in 2013 took place
before the bride’s 18 th birthday.
DEATH PENALTY
Eleven men were executed on 21 December,
the first executions in Jordan since 2006. This
followed the establishment in November of a
special committee of the cabinet to look into
the resumption of executions.
KAZAKHSTAN
Republic of Kazakhstan
Head of state: Nursultan Nazarbayev
Head of government: Karim Massimov (replaced
Serik Akhmetov in April)
There was no improvement in investigating
reports of human rights violations by law
enforcement and security services and
holding alleged perpetrators to account.
Bureaucratic obstacles and opaque internal
ministerial regulations prevented victims
of torture and their relatives from obtaining
justice. Similar obstacles continued to
hinder effective independent monitoring of
places of detention. The right to freedom of
assembly continued to be restricted. Civil
society activists feared that new legislative
proposals would restrict their freedoms of
expression and association.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The authorities repeatedly asserted their
commitment to eliminating torture and
other ill-treatment. In September 2013,
the Prosecutor General instructed national
prosecutors to “open a criminal investigation
into every incident of torture”. However, in
practice investigations into allegations of
torture and other ill-treatment fell far short
209of international standards and failed to
deliver justice.
In November the UN Committee against
Torture expressed concern at “the gap
between legislation and protection from
torture”, noting that the use of torture and
other ill-treatment to obtain confessions
“went beyond isolated incidents”, and that
less than 2% of complaints of torture led
to prosecution. In October, at Kazakhstan’s
second round Universal Periodic Review, the
UN Human Rights Council recommended
that Kazakhstan establish an independent
investigations mechanism.
The Criminal Procedural Code provides
that an official body should not investigate
complaints against its own officials. However,
complaints of torture and other ill-treatment
made against law enforcement and national
security officials were routinely referred to
the internal investigations departments of the
Ministry of Internal Affairs, Financial Police or
the Committee for National Security (KNB).
These internal investigation departments are
governed by internal regulations, which have
not been made public. In practice this meant
that instead of an impartial investigation
by a separate authority, torture complaints
were put through an internal screening
process, which usually failed to check
them objectively. In most cases, screening
procedures concluded that complaints were
unfounded or that the perpetrators could not
be identified.
Independent NGOs registered between
350 and 400 complaints of torture and other
ill-treatment in Kazakhstan annually in 2013
and 2014. However, they estimated that
since 2010 the authorities had succeeded
in bringing only some 50 officials to justice.
According to the website of the Office of the
Prosecutor General, only 43 crimes of torture
were registered from January to September,
with 47 individuals identified as alleged
victims, including 11 prisoners, three minors
and one elderly person. During the same
period, 17 torture-related cases went on trial
and 30 cases were closed because of the
210
“absence of elements of a crime”, official
language typically used after inadequate
internal investigations. The website also
stated that in 2013 and the first half of 2014,
31 police officers were convicted of torture-
related crimes, but did not specify the nature
of the crimes committed, nor the number of
incidents these related to.
In November 2013, Kostanai Regional
Court awarded 2 million Kazakhstani Tenge
(US$13,000) in compensation to Aleksandr
Gerasimov following a decision by the UN
Committee against Torture in May 2012,
which found Kazakhstan responsible for his
torture. However, the authorities had yet to
carry out a full and independent investigation
into Aleksandr Gerasimov’s torture complaint.
In November, Roza Tuletaeva, a labour
rights activist, was released from prison on
parole. She had been serving a five-year
sentence for “inciting social discord” during
the 2011 oil workers’ strike in Zhanaozen.
At her trial in 2012 she told the court that
she had been tortured during interrogations.
There was no information of any impartial
investigations into her allegations of torture.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The authorities continued to invoke
countering terrorism and other threats to
national security as crucial to securing
national and regional stability. There were
frequent reports of KNB officers violating
human rights, including using torture and
other ill-treatment to obtain confessions.
Among those particularly targeted by the
KNB were members or presumed members
of banned or unregistered Islamic groups
and Islamist parties; members of religious
minorities; and asylum-seekers from
neighbouring countries, particularly China
and Uzbekistan.
Relatives of some of those convicted
of terrorism-related offences claimed that
prisoners in Shymkent and Arkalyk high
security prisons were serving their sentences
in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Only limited independent monitoring access
was allowed at these facilities.
In January 2013, legislation was introduced
which provided for broader measures in
countering terrorism and extremism, and
the newly adopted Criminal Code, signed
by President Nazarbayev on 3 July 2014
and expected to come into force in January
2015, lowered the age of criminal liability for
terrorism-related offences to 14 years. The
crime of “terrorism with loss of life”, in Article
49.1 of the Criminal Code, was the only crime
still punishable by death although Kazakhstan
remained abolitionist in practice.
PRISON CONDITIONS
In 2013 Kazakhstan adopted legislation to set
up a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM).
Its civil society members were elected on
19 February 2014 at the first session of the
NPM Coordination Council, after which they
began monitoring detention facilities across
Kazakhstan. However, the NPM mandate
did not extend to all places of deprivation of
liberty. For example, the monitoring group
was not permitted to inspect offices of police
departments and had no access to other
closed state institutions such as orphanages,
nursing homes and military barracks. The
NPM also faced bureaucratic obstacles: in
order to undertake an urgent and unplanned
visit, NPM members had to obtain written
permission from the Ombudsman, which
could only be obtained during working hours,
thus restricting the NPM’s ability to respond
rapidly to reports of torture. The NPM was
also not allowed to publish the results of its
findings until the Ombudsman had approved
its annual report.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Freedom of assembly was restricted and
peaceful protesters continued to be detained
and fined. Activists were required to obtain
prior permission from the local authorities for
any public gathering or single-person picket.
Distributing leaflets, joining spontaneous
protests or wearing clothing displaying
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
political slogans without prior permission
were often regarded as violations of legislation
on public protests. In several incidents law
enforcement officials used force to break up
unauthorized peaceful meetings. In dozens of
cases, organizers and participants were fined
or sentenced to administrative detention for
up to 15 days.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
NGO registration was compulsory. Authorities
enjoyed wide discretion to deny such status
and to close down groups for alleged,
often minor, violations of the law. The
new Criminal Code and other related laws
contained provisions that human rights
groups believed could be used to harass
NGOs and their members, and to restrict their
legitimate activities.
The new Criminal Code classified “leading,
participating in or financing unregistered or
banned associations” as criminal offences. It
also criminalized “unlawful interference” in
the activities of state agencies by members
of public associations and defined leaders of
public associations as a separate category of
offenders, providing for stiffer penalties for
them for a number of crimes.
A working group set up by the Ministry of
Culture was drafting a law regulating NGO
activities that would establish legal grounds
for channelling all state and non-state funding
for NGOs through a special NGO set up by
the government. NGOs were concerned this
might limit their opportunities for independent
fundraising.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION – MEDIA
Freedom of expression significantly
deteriorated for independent media. In
February, Pravdivaya Gazeta newspaper was
closed down under a court ruling for minor
transgressions. Social media and blogs were

were blocked by court decisions taken in

211KENYA
Republic of Kenya
Head of state and government: Uhuru Muigai
Kenyatta
Attacks attributed to the Somali-based
armed group, Al-Shabaab, increased. Police
counter-terror operations resulted in several
deaths and the arrest of hundreds of people.
The authorities intensified measures to
restrict and control the activities of civil
society organizations. There were incidents
of unlawful killing, rape, torture or other
ill-treatment by the police. Violence against
women and girls persisted.
BACKGROUND
Kenya’s economy and security were affected
by a number of violent attacks in north-
eastern Kenya, in the capital, Nairobi,
and the coastal towns of Mombasa and
Lamu, which triggered the adoption of new
security laws with wide-reaching human
rights implications. Implementation of the
devolved system of government continued
although challenges remained including
inconsistent policy, legal and institutional
frameworks. County authorities demanded
constitutional amendments to increase their
share of national treasury resources. The trial
of Deputy President William Samoei Ruto
and journalist Joshua Arap Sang continued
at the International Criminal Court while
the Prosecutor withdrew charges against
President Kenyatta.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
Violent attacks increased, mostly attributed
to Al-Shabaab, an armed group operating
in Somalia. Al-Shabaab claimed the attacks
were in retaliation for the continued presence
of Kenya’s armed forces in Somalia, as part
of the African Union Mission to Somalia
(AMISOM). Grenade and bomb attacks
resulting in fatalities and serious injuries
212
occurred in various places including in a
restaurant, a densely populated market and
on commuter buses. The majority of the
attacks took place in northeastern Kenya,
Nairobi, Mombasa and Lamu.
On 23 March, gunmen opened fire in a
Mombasa church during a service, killing six
and injuring at least 15 people.
On 15 June, gunmen attacked the town
of Mpeketoni in Lamu County, killing at
least 48 people. The gunmen also burned
44 vehicles and about 26 buildings. At least
14 other people were killed in two separate
attacks in nearby villages on 16 and 24
June. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility
for the attacks but the authorities blamed
local politicians. The Governor of Lamu
County was arrested and released on bail on
suspicion of being involved in the killings,
but investigations failed to gather sufficient
evidence against him. An investigation by
the Independent Policing Oversight Authority
(IPOA) into police action around the attacks
found that the police response was slow and
disjointed. A dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed in
Lamu town in the aftermath of the killings was
lifted on 24 December.
On 22 November, gunmen attacked a
bus in Mandera, northeastern Kenya, killing
28 passengers. The gunmen reportedly
separated Muslims from non-Muslims before
killing the latter. On 2 December, 36 miners
were killed in another attack at a quarry in
Koromei, Mandera County. Following the
attacks, the Inspector General of Police
resigned; the Cabinet Secretary of Interior
and Co-ordination of National Government
was sacked. Also in December, the
government hastily and without meaningful
public participation enacted a new security
law, amending numerous provisions in 22
existing laws with far-reaching human rights
implications. Among other things, it creates
new criminal offences with harsh penalties,
limits the rights of arrested and accused
people, expands the powers of intelligence
officers to arrest suspects and monitor
communications, and caps the number of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15refugees in Kenya at 150,000. The law was
enacted despite a chaotic and disorderly
parliamentary sitting.
The police conducted a number of counter-
terror operations during the year including
in mosques believed to be recruiting and
training young attendees to become jihadists.
In February, seven people were reportedly
shot dead while 129 were arrested when the
police conducted an operation in a mosque in
Mombasa. Most of those arrested were later
released without charge. One man who was
arrested during the operation has not been
seen since.
In April, thousands of Somali refugees
and asylum-seekers were arbitrarily arrested,
harassed, extorted and ill-treated as part of a
counter-terror operation known as “Usalama
Watch” (see Somalia entry). Over five
thousand individuals were forcibly relocated
to refugee camps in northern Kenya and
at least 359 others were expelled back to
Somalia. In June, the High Court ruled that
the forced relocation of refugees to camps
was constitutional, contradicting a previous
decision on the same matter. In July, the
IPOA issued a report which concluded
that, in addition to violating human rights,
the operation was counter-productive as it
engendered perceptions of ethnic profiling
and discrimination among Somalis.
In November, the police conducted
operations in four mosques in Mombasa. One
person was shot dead during the operations
while more than 300 were arrested. The
police reported that they recovered grenades
and other crude weapons from the mosques.
The operations provoked violent clashes
in Mombasa.
The Anti-Terror Police Unit continued to
be accused by both local and international
civil society organizations of human rights
violations including extrajudicial killings
and enforced disappearances. A number
of Mombasa-based Muslim clerics were
shot dead by unidentified assailants during
the year; both radical and moderate clerics
were targeted. On 1 April, a Muslim cleric
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
accused by the police of recruiting youths
into Al-Shabaab was gunned down in a
Mombasa street. In June, an anti-jihad cleric
and chairperson of the Council of Imams
and Preachers of Kenya was shot dead at
a mosque. In November a Muslim cleric
supportive of government efforts against
radicalization was shot dead.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
The International Criminal Court (ICC) trial
of Deputy President William Samoei Ruto
and journalist Joshua Arap Sang for alleged
crimes against humanity committed during
the 2007/2008 post-election violence
continued throughout the year. The trial was
undermined by alleged witness intimidation
and bribery, and the withdrawal of other
witnesses. The Trial Chamber issued
summonses to nine prosecution witnesses
who no longer wished to appear voluntarily.
By the end of the year, three of the nine
witnesses had testified via video-link from an
undisclosed location in Nairobi.
On 5 December, the ICC Prosecutor
withdrew charges against President Kenyatta.
He had been charged with crimes against
humanity committed during the post-election
violence. The Prosecutor explained that the
evidence at her disposal was insufficient to
prove President Kenyatta’s alleged criminal
responsibility beyond reasonable doubt. She
stated that efforts by her office to gather
relevant evidence had been hampered
by the death of several key witnesses,
intimidation of prosecution witnesses
leading to the withdrawal of at least seven
testimonies, and non-co-operation by the
Kenyan government. On 3 December, while
rejecting the Prosecutor’s request for a
further adjournment of the case, the ICC Trial
Chamber ruled that the Kenyan government’s
conduct in the case fell short of the standard
of good faith co-operation but declined to
refer a formal finding of non-co-operation to
the Assembly of States Parties.
213The ICC arrest warrant issued for Walter
Osapiri Barasa had not been executed at the
end of the year.
The government continued its efforts to
discredit and weaken the ICC. In March,
Kenya submitted to the UN Secretary-General
five proposed amendments to the Rome
Statute of the ICC, including that Article
27 be amended to preclude the ICC from
prosecuting heads of state and government
while in office. In November, the Kenyan
government requested the inclusion of a
supplementary agenda item titled “Special
session to discuss the conduct of the Court
and the Office of the Prosecutor”, to the
provisional agenda of the 13th session of the
Assembly of State Parties in December. The
request was denied.
IMPUNITY – POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE
Perpetrators of crimes committed during the
post-election violence remained unpunished
at the national level. In February, the Director
of Public Prosecutions announced that a
review of more than 4,000 post-election
investigation files had failed to identify any
prosecutable cases due to lack of evidence.
In March a group of internally displaced
people protested outside State House against
the government’s failure to provide them
with assistance. No concrete steps were
taken to establish the International Crimes
Division of the High Court or to implement the
recommendations of the Truth, Justice and
Reconciliation Commission.
Three civil cases filed by victims and civil
society organizations challenging the failure of
the government to address various violations
committed during the post-election violence
were still pending at the end of the year.
In October, an opposition political party
submitted to Parliament a draft bill titled “The
Post Election Violence Tribunal Bill – 2014”.
The draft bill proposed the establishment of a
tribunal to try perpetrators of crimes against
humanity committed during the post-election
violence. Provisions in the draft bill included
trials in the absence of the accused, the
214
death penalty and posthumous convictions.
The draft bill was pending at the end of
the year.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Police reforms
In April, the National Police Service
Commission Act was amended, subjecting
the human resources functions of the
National Police Service Commission (NPSC)
to the authority of the Inspector General of
Police. In June, the National Police Service
Act was amended to make the Inspector
General of Police responsible for all matters
relating to the command and discipline of the
police. The police operated without adequate
resources and equipment. On 31 October,
at least 19 police officers were ambushed
and killed by armed bandits in Kapedo,
Baringo County.
The vetting of police officers continued. At
the end of November, the NPSC had vetted
198 police officers, 16 of whom were deemed
unfit to serve in the force mainly for reasons
related to corruption. The process was
hampered by lack of finances, limited public
participation, and the resignation of four key
members of the vetting board. Local NGOs
and the IPOA expressed concern that the
process had failed to clean up the force and
that it had not seriously taken into account
the human rights record of police officers.
Human rights violations by police
There were incidents of unlawful killing, rape
and torture or other ill-treatment by police.
In August, a 14-year-old girl was shot
dead when eight police officers stormed
her family’s home ostensibly to arrest her
uncle. Two police officers were subsequently
charged with her murder.
In October, a woman who had gone to a
police post to report an assault was reportedly
raped by a police officer. The IPOA launched
investigations into the incident.
During the year, at least two separate
police county commanders issued public
statements instructing police officers under
their command to use lethal force against
Amnesty International Report 2014/15suspected terrorists. The Kenya National
Commission on Human Rights and the IPOA
condemned the instructions as unlawful.
CRACKDOWN ON CIVIL
SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS
The authorities intensified measures to restrict
and control the activities of civil society
organizations. In May, Parliament published
a bill proposing amendments to the Public
Benefits Organizations (PBO) Act. In October,
an earlier proposal to limit foreign funding of
NGOs to 15% was retabled in Parliament.
In December, the government deregistered
and froze the financial accounts of 510
NGOs that it said had not complied with the
NGO law. Among these were 15 unnamed
NGOs accused of financing terrorism. The
government also issued a 21 days’ notice to
10 international NGOs and two other local
NGOs to submit audited financial accounts.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
In February, a taskforce established in 2012
to develop an evictions and resettlement
law presented a proposed bill to the Cabinet
Secretary for Land, Housing and Urban
Development. In March, the Cabinet
Secretary issued a public statement pledging
to expedite the enactment of an evictions law.
By the end of the year, the draft bill had not
been submitted to Parliament for debate.
In October, the High Court ordered the
government to pay compensation of 33.6
million shillings (US$390,000) to residents
of City Carton informal settlement in Nairobi,
who were forcefully evicted from their homes
in May 2013. The High Court ruled that
the government was under an obligation to
protect slum dwellers from forced eviction
by third parties. By the end of the year, the
government had not complied with a number
of orders emanating from previous court
decisions on the right to housing.
persisted. Despite a 2011 law prohibiting
female genital mutilation (FGM), the practice
continued in several parts of the country
including in northern Kenya and among the
Maasai, Kisii and Kuria ethnic communities.
In June, hundreds of women and men from
the Maasai community held two separate
demonstrations protesting against the
prohibition of FGM. The police took action
against government local administrators who
were alleged accomplices in acts of FGM. In
April, a chief was charged in court after his
two daughters underwent FGM, while another
was charged with failing to report acts of FGM
carried out within his administrative area.
In November in Nairobi, there were at
least five incidents of public stripping and
groping of women deemed by mobs of men
to be indecently dressed. In one incident a
police officer was part of a group of men on
a commuter bus who groped and threatened
a woman with rape. The perpetrators of the
incident were charged in court with a number
of offences. Following a public demonstration
on 17 November calling on the authorities
to take swift action to prevent and punish
acts of violence against women, the police
formed an Anti-stripping Squad to monitor
and investigate incidents of public stripping
of women.

215KOREA
(DEMOCRATIC
PEOPLE’S
REPUBLIC OF)
Democratic People's Republic of Korea
Head of state: Kim Jong-un
Head of government: Pak Pong-ju
The UN released a comprehensive report
on the human rights situation in the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
(North Korea, DPRK), which gave details
on the systematic violation of almost the
entire range of human rights. Hundreds
of thousands of people continued to
be detained in prison camps and other
detention facilities, many of them without
being charged or tried for any internationally
recognizable crime. Freedoms of expression,
religion and movement, both within and
outside the country, remained severely
restricted. The fate of people forcibly
disappeared was still unknown, despite
the government admitting the involvement
of state agents in the abduction of some
individuals.
BACKGROUND
The third year of Kim Jong-un’s rule started in
December 2013 with the high-profile trial and
execution of Jang Song-taek, vice-chairman
of the National Defence Commission and
uncle of Kim Jong-un. This was believed to
be the beginning of a series of political purges
in order to further consolidate Kim Jong-
un’s power, although there were no other
confirmed executions of political opponents
linked with Jang during 2014.
An officially illegal, but government-
tolerated, private economy continued to
expand, including privately operated food
and clothing stalls. It was feared by observers
216
that the apparent economic opening could
create greater income disparities. It was not
accompanied by an improvement in the
general human rights situation.
The government attempted to bring in
foreign exchange currency, including through
tourism. Despite such efforts, the state
remained highly sensitive to any actions
by foreign visitors that were perceived to
be spreading political or religious ideas not
compatible with those promoted by the state.
Freedom of information was limited and
the internet was not publicly accessible. A
national “intranet” was set up instead.
A rare display of accountability from the
government was seen in May, when state
media reported promptly the collapse of an
apartment building in the capital, Pyongyang,
that killed more than 300 people. Foreign
media in Pyongyang reported that citizens
had expressed their anger over the incident
and the government issued an apology over
faulty construction methods.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
The UN Commission of Inquiry on Human
Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea released its report in February. 1
The 372-page document presented a
comprehensive review of “systematic,
widespread and gross human rights
violations” and concluded that many of these
amounted to crimes against humanity.
The report was presented to the UN
Human Rights Council in March, where a
strong resolution was passed welcoming
the report, which garnered support from a
majority of Council member states. 2
The DPRK underwent a second Universal
Periodic Review (UPR) process in May.
The government was more engaged than
during its first UPR in 2010, and this time
gave responses on which recommendations
it supported, including those relating to
the effective operation of humanitarian aid.
However, the government refused to accept
more than half of the recommendations,
in particular those directed at co-operation
Amnesty International Report 2014/15with the Commission of Inquiry and the
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human
rights in the DPRK. It also rejected outright
recommendations to close its political prison
camps, or to allow foreign victims of enforced
disappearance to return freely to their
countries of origin. 3
In December, the UN General Assembly
passed a strong resolution recommending the
referral of the human rights situation in the
DPRK to the International Criminal Court.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Hundreds of thousands of people remained
detained in political prison camps and
other detention facilities, where they were
subject to systematic, widespread and gross
human rights violations such as extrajudicial
executions and torture and other ill-treatment,
including beatings, long periods of forced
hard labour without rest and deprivation
of food.
Many of those held in political prison
camps had not been convicted of any
internationally recognizable crime, but were
relatives of those deemed threatening to the
administration. They were detained without a
fair trial, through “guilt-by-association”.
The government continued to deny the
existence of political prison camps, even
though satellite images showed not only their
presence, but also ongoing expansion at
some of the camps as of the end of 2013.
North Koreans as well as foreign citizens
were subject to arbitrary detention after
unfair trials. Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd
Miller, both US nationals, were convicted of
“hostile acts” against the regime in 2013
and 2014 respectively. Before their release
in November, they had begun serving terms
of forced hard labour of 15 and six years
respectively. In an interview with foreign
media in August, Kenneth Bae spoke about
the unfair trial he received as well as his
deteriorating health while working in a
labour camp.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
The practice of any religion continued to
be severely restricted. Both DPRK and
foreign nationals reportedly received heavy
punishments for exercising their freedom of
religion, including detention in prison camps. 4
John Short, an Australian missionary,
was arrested for promoting his religious
beliefs and was deported in March only
after apologizing publicly. Kim Jung-wook, a
missionary from South Korea, was detained
for more than six months without access to a
lawyer, before being convicted of setting up
an underground church and spying. He was
sentenced to forced hard labour for life.
Jeffrey Fowle, a tourist from the USA, was
arrested in May for leaving a bible at a club
in Chongjin. He was detained for more than
five months without trial before being released
in October.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Authorities continued to impose severe
restrictions on the exercise of the right
to freedoms of expression, opinion and
peaceful assembly. There appeared to be
no independent civil society organizations,
newspapers or political parties. North Koreans
were liable to be searched by authorities for
the possession of foreign media materials,
and could be punished for listening to,
watching or reading such materials.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
Border controls remained tight. The number
of people arriving in South Korea after fleeing
from the north remained low in 2012 and
2013 compared with previous years.
The difficulty of crossing the border was
increased through enhanced surveillance
technology according to media in South
Korea, including the use of jamming
equipment designed to stop citizens using
Chinese cellular phones along the border. The
use of mobile phones for citizens remained
confined to a closed local network within
North Korea.
217A group of approximately 29 people,
including a one-year-old baby, were forcibly
returned to North Korea in early August
after being detained in China. While it was
not known whether they were charged for
crossing the border illegally, they would face
possible imprisonment and torture and other
ill-treatment, including forced labour, if such
charges were brought against them. 5

Restrictions remained in place for those
attempting to monitor delivery of food aid to
targeted groups.

ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
The UN Working Group on Enforced or
Involuntary Disappearances asked the DPRK
in August for confirmation regarding the fate
of 47 people who were known to have been
abducted on foreign soil by North Korean
security agents and who subsequently
disappeared. A majority of these were citizens
of South Korea.
The government engaged in meetings
with Japan in May to address the issue
of abductions, and launched a special
committee to reinvestigate cases of Japanese
nationals abducted during the 1970s and
1980s. The initial report of the reinvestigation
was, however, rejected by Japan as it
contained no new information about the 12
Japanese nationals already officially admitted
by North Korea as having been abducted
from Japan by North Korean security agents.
RIGHT TO FOOD
The World Food Programme reported
in September that the situation of food
availability in North Korea was “severe”.
Despite improved harvests in the two previous
years, a dry spell in 2014 brought food ration
levels down from 410 to only 250 grams per
person per day in August, which was widely
seen as an indication of imminent shortage
in food availability. Latest statistics revealed
that rates of chronic malnutrition remained
relatively high in 2013, affecting one in four
children aged under five.
While North Korea received humanitarian
assistance from the World Food Programme
and other relief agencies, the government did
not allow the agencies to extend assistance

KOREA
(REPUBLIC OF)
Republic of Korea
Head of state: Park Geun-hye
Head of government: Chung Hong-won
The rights of workers were violated through
the denial of freedom of association, the
curtailment of legitimate collective action
and, for migrant workers, exploitation
under the Employment Permit System. The
government increasingly restricted freedom
of expression by using the National Security
Law to intimidate and imprison people.
Police blocked peaceful protests. At least
635 conscientious objectors remained
in prison.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15BACKGROUND
The second year of Park Geun-hye’s term
as president showed a regressive trend in
the realization of human rights. Numerous
concerns surfaced including barriers to
freedoms of assembly and expression.
Following the deaths of more than 300
people, many of them students, in the
accidental sinking of the Sewol ferry in April,
further concerns were raised on issues
such as disaster response effectiveness and
impartiality of investigations. Further concerns
about government abuse of power were raised
in two espionage cases when the National
Intelligence Service was criticized for allegedly
fabricating evidence.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Migrant agricultural workers under the
Employment Permit System (EPS) endured
excessive working hours, underpayment,
denial of their weekly paid rest day and
annual leave, illegal subcontracting and
poor living conditions. Many were also
discriminated against at work due to their
nationality. The exclusion of agricultural
workers from the Labour Standards Act
provisions on working hours, daily breaks
and weekly paid rest days was discriminatory
in effect as it disproportionately affected
migrant workers. Many were unable to escape
exploitative working conditions due to severe
government restrictions on migrants’ ability to
change jobs as well as the exclusion by the
Labour Standards Act of agricultural workers
from legal protection.
Many migrants interviewed by Amnesty
International had been coerced by their
employers into working under harsh
conditions amounting to forced labour, most
commonly through threats and violence.
Many had been recruited using deception for
the purpose of exploitation, a situation that
amounted to trafficking.
Migrant workers lodging complaints often
had to continue working for their employers
during investigations, thereby putting them
at risk of further abuse. Those who left
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
their workplace risked being reported to
immigration authorities as “runaways” by
their employers, and subjected to arrest and
deportation.
The EPS discouraged migrant workers from
making complaints and changing jobs for fear
of losing the ability to extend their contract,
and some officials actively dissuaded
migrants from making formal complaints.
Consequently, employers abusing migrant
workers rarely faced legal sanctions. 1
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
– TRADE UNIONS
Trade unions faced increasing restrictions.
Several trade union leaders were criminally
charged or even imprisoned for engaging in
collective action and other legitimate trade
union activities.
Kim Jung-woo, a former leader of the
Ssangyong Motor branch of the Korean Metal
Workers’ Union, had been sentenced in
2013 to 10 months in prison for preventing
municipal government officials from
dismantling a protest site in the capital Seoul.
He was released on bail in April 2014 after
completing his original sentence, but faced
an appeal by the prosecution seeking a
heavier sentence.
The Ministry of Labour and Employment
sought to deregister the Korean Teachers’ and
Education Workers’ Union (KTU) in 2013,
and this was affirmed through a ruling by
the Seoul Administrative Court in June 2014.
However, the Seoul High Court suspended
execution of this ruling in September, pending
an appeal.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The government continued its use of the
National Security Law (NSL) to curtail
freedom of expression. At least 32 people
were charged for violations of the NSL in
the first eight months of the year. This was
less than in 2013, when 129 people were
investigated or charged under the NSL, the
highest number in a decade, but remained a
matter of great concern.
219Lee Seok-ki, a National Assembly member
from the Unified Progressive Party (UPP),
was imprisoned along with six other party
members for “conspiracy to revolt”, “inciting
an insurrection”, and activities deemed to
violate the NSL. On appeal in August, the
Seoul High Court dismissed the charges of
“conspiracy to revolt”, but upheld the other
charges, and reduced the prison sentences to
terms ranging from two to nine years.
The government also sought to disband the
UPP before the Constitutional Court, which
ruled in December that the party had violated
the basic democratic order and disbanded
the party. This was the first such request
from the government since democratization in
1987 and the first time a party was disbanded
since 1958.

and religion. 2
ARMS TRADE
South Korea exported substantial amounts
of tear gas shells to countries where tear
gas was used indiscriminately in riot
control. 3 Following pressure from Amnesty
International and other human rights
groups, the government announced a halt to
shipments of tear gas to Bahrain in January. 4
South Korea signed the Arms Trade Treaty
in 2013, but had yet to ratify the treaty and
incorporate it into domestic legislation by the
end of 2014.
1. Bitter Harvest: Exploitation and forced labour of migrant agricultural
workers in South Korea (ASA 25/004/2014)
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Since the ferry accident in April, more than
300 people were arrested in attempts by
police to quell peaceful demonstrations
expressing discontent over the government’s
response to the ferry sinking. Police
blockades of street rallies continued for
months following the accident.
In June, the police cracked down on
a peaceful protest in the city of Miryang,
injuring 14 protesters. Some 300 protesters,
many of whom were elderly, were protesting
against the construction of high-voltage
electricity transmission towers, and
demanding genuine consultation.
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
At least 635 conscientious objectors remained
in prison at the end of the year.
Members of the public voiced concerns
about the system of compulsory military
service following the deaths of two male
conscripts, which revealed evidence of
ongoing ill-treatment in the military.
Amnesty International, along with several
other NGOs, submitted arguments in
August in a case before the Constitutional
Court addressing the right to conscientious
objection to military service as derived from

Peaceful criticism of the Amir, other state

Those targeted for arrest, detention and
prosecution included human rights and
political reform activists. Authorities used
Amnesty International Report 2014/15a telecommunications law to prosecute and
imprison critics who expressed dissent using
social media, and curtailed the right to
public assembly. The government continued
to withhold nationality and citizenship rights
from tens of thousands of Bidun people,
and arbitrarily stripped several critics and
members of their families of their Kuwaiti
citizenship. Women faced discrimination in
law and practice. Foreign migrant workers,
who comprised over half of the population,
lacked adequate protection under the
law and were subject to discrimination,
exploitation and abuse. The death penalty
remained in force for a range of crimes; no
executions were reported.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In April, the Public Prosecutor banned media
discussion about a publicly available video
recording that reportedly showed two former
senior political figures discussing a plot to
replace the Amir and take control of the
government. The authorities stripped a media
owner of his Kuwaiti nationality after his TV
and radio station allegedly breached the
media ban.
At least eight people were sentenced for
comments they had made on social media,
following prosecutions under Penal Code
provisions that criminalized “insult” to the
Amir and other state authorities and religion,
and provisions of a 2001 law prohibiting
the use of telecommunications facilities to
disseminate criticism. Up to 10 others faced
a cycle of prosecution, trial, conviction and
appeal in connection with the expression of
their views, mainly via the website Twitter.
They included human rights activist and
blogger Abdullah Fairouz, arrested in
November 2013, who was sentenced in
January to five years in prison for messages
he posted on Twitter. 1 In July, an appeal court
upheld a 10-year prison sentence imposed on
blogger Hamad al-Naqi in 2012 for allegedly
defaming religion and foreign leaders.
In July, the authorities arrested former
parliamentarian Musallam al-Barrak, a vocal
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
government critic, after he reportedly accused
senior officials of bribery and corruption in
a speech to a large crowd in June. He was
detained for 10 days and then released
to stand trial on charges of “insulting” the
judiciary. His arrest prompted widespread
protests and accusations that the police had
used excessive force against protesters, which
the government denied. He continued to face
a number of expression-related prosecutions
at the end of the year.
DEPRIVATION OF NATIONALITY
The government resorted to the new tactic
of arbitrarily stripping some of its critics and
their dependents of their Kuwaiti citizenship
rights under provisions of the 1959 nationality
law. 2 In July, the authorities stripped the
nationality of Ahmed Jabr al-Shammari,
owner of the Al-Yawm newspaper and TV
channel, and four others, along with their
dependents, rendering over 30 people
stateless. The authorities revoked the
citizenship of at least 10 others in August and
a further 15 in September.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The authorities failed to independently
investigate allegations of torture of detainees
by security officials. In a letter to Amnesty
International in September, the government
denied that arbitrary arrests took place during
demonstrations or that officials committed
torture or ill-treatment.
Bidun human rights activist ‘Abdulhakim
al-Fadhli complained to an investigating
prosecutor in February that police had
beaten him in detention to force him to sign
a “confession”. The prosecutor failed to
order a medical examination requested by
‘Abdulhakim al-Fadhli or to take any other
steps to investigate the alleged torture.
DISCRIMINATION – BIDUN
The government continued to deny Kuwaiti
nationality – and the rights and benefits
associated with it, including free education,
free health care and the right to vote – to
221tens of thousands of Bidun, although a
small number were officially recognized as
Kuwaiti citizens.
In October 2012, the Prime Minister
had assured Amnesty International that
the government would resolve the issue
of citizenship for Kuwait’s Bidun residents
within five years; at the end of 2014 that
appeared unlikely.
Members of the Bidun community
demonstrated to demand an end to
discrimination, despite the ban on public
gatherings by “non-citizens”. Some
demonstrations were dispersed by police,
but the government denied using excessive
force. Scores of Bidun continued to face
trial on charges of illegal gathering or public
order offences. Many trials were repeatedly
postponed, but in September 67 were
acquitted. The authorities also detained
at least 15 Bidun activists, mostly on
charges relating to public order offences or
“illegal gathering”.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty remained in force for
murder and other crimes. At least five people
were sentenced to death; no executions
were reported.

WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Kuwaiti women enjoyed greater rights than
women in most other Gulf region states,
including rights to stand as candidates and
vote in elections, but they were not accorded
equality under the law with men. The law
required that women have a male “guardian”
in family matters, such as divorce, child
custody and inheritance, and when receiving
medical treatment.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Migrant workers, who made up the majority
of Kuwait’s workforce, continued to face
exploitation and abuse linked partly to the
official kafala sponsorship system. Migrant
domestic workers, mostly women from Asian
countries, were especially vulnerable as
they were excluded from forms of protection
afforded to other workers by Kuwait’s
labour laws.
222
The authorities failed to take effective
measures to address allegations of
torture and other ill-treatment and bring
perpetrators to justice. No impartial and
effective investigation took place into
human rights violations, including crimes
against humanity, committed during the
June 2010 violence and its aftermath. MPs
initiated draft laws that if adopted would
have a negative impact on civil society.
Prisoner of conscience Azimjan Askarov
remained in detention.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment persisted
despite a programme of independent
monitoring of places of detention and the
establishment of the National Centre for
the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment.
On 20 December 2013, the UN Committee
against Torture issued its concluding
observations on the second periodic report on
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Kyrgyzstan. The Committee expressed grave
concern “about the ongoing and widespread
practice of torture and ill-treatment of persons
deprived of their liberty, in particular while in
police custody to extract confessions”. On 23
April 2014, the UN Human Rights Committee
considered the second periodic report of the
Kyrgyz Republic.
Both Committees highlighted the failure
of the authorities to promptly, impartially
and fully investigate allegations of torture
and other ill-treatment and to prosecute
perpetrators. They expressed concern about
the lack of a full and effective investigation
into the June 2010 violence. 1 The Committees
also urged Kyrgyzstan to address these
concerns by taking immediate and effective
measures to prevent acts of torture and ill-
treatment, by tackling impunity, prosecuting
perpetrators and conducting investigations
into all allegations of torture and other ill-
treatment, including in cases related to the
June 2010 violence.
On 16 June 2014, the Jalal-Abad regional
human rights organization Spravedlivost
(Justice) recorded two incidents of torture
during a monitoring visit to the Jalal-Abad
temporary detention centre. A medical
practitioner, who was part of the monitoring
group, documented the signs of torture.
One detainee alleged that police officers had
beaten him with hands and fists and a book,
and put a plastic bag over his head. He was
handcuffed to a radiator until the next day.
He suffered concussion as a result of the
ill-treatment. Another detainee alleged that
police officers hit him in the larynx, kicked
him in the stomach and beat his head with
a book. Spravedlivost submitted complaints
to the Jalal-Abad city prosecutor. After
conducting an initial check and ordering
two forensic medical examinations, the city
prosecutor nevertheless refused to open
criminal investigations into these allegations.
In 2014 the European Court of Human
Rights issued three judgments against
Russia, in which it stated that if ethnic
Uzbek applicants were to be extradited to
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Kyrgyzstan, they would be at risk of torture or
other ill-treatment.
IMPUNITY
Criminal investigations into allegations of
torture were rare. In the first half of 2014,
the Prosecutor General’s Office registered
109 complaints, but only in nine cases were
criminal investigations initiated; of these only
three went to trial. Trials were ongoing at the
end of the year.
The media reported that on 26 November
2013, the Sverdlovsk District Court of Bishkek
handed down the first ever conviction for
torture under Article 305-1 of the Criminal
Code. Police officer Adilet Motuev was
sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. The
Court found that he had illegally brought
a man to a police station after accusing
him of stealing a mobile phone. Adilet
Motuev threatened the man and forced
him to confess to the theft by squeezing the
handcuffs and putting a plastic bag on his
head and suffocating him. However, in 2014
the Court of Second Instance acquitted Adilet
Motuev of all torture charges and changed
the sentence to two years’ imprisonment for
unauthorized conduct of an investigation.
The authorities failed to take any steps
to fairly and effectively investigate the June
2010 violence and its aftermath in the cities
of Osh and Jalal-Abad. Lawyers defending
ethnic Uzbeks detained in the context of the
violence continued to be targeted for their
work, threatened and physically attacked,
even in the courtroom, with no accountability
for the perpetrators.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
On 3 September 2014, the Supreme Court
once again turned down an appeal lodged by
Azimjan Askarov’s lawyer to re-investigate the
case against him. Earlier in the year, Bishkek
City Court had annulled the ruling by Bishkek
District Court that the case must be reviewed
on the basis that the defence had presented
new evidence.
223FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
AND ASSOCIATION
Civil society activists dealing with human
rights issues reported pressure from the
authorities because of their work, resulting in
a heightened sense of insecurity among them.
In May 2014, the Ministry of Justice
proposed amendments to NGO legislation
that would abolish the right to establish
NGOs without legal status. If passed, the
amendments would criminalize the activities
of all unregistered NGOs. Some deputies
called for Parliament to push through the
adoption of a law similar to that passed
in Russia requiring NGOs to adopt the
stigmatizing label of “foreign agents” if they
receive foreign funds and engage in “political”
activities. In November, the parliamentary
Committee on Human Rights, Constitutional
Law and State Structure recommended that
the proposed amendments be withdrawn.
DISCRIMINATION
The UN Human Rights Committee expressed
concerns about the lack of comprehensive
anti-discrimination legislation prohibiting
discrimination on grounds such as race,
language, disability and ethnic origin.
On 15 October, Parliament passed in
its first reading a draft law prohibiting the
promotion of so-called non-traditional sexual
relations, thus increasing the vulnerability
of groups defending the rights of sexual
minorities. The proposed amendments
would criminalize any action aimed at
creating a positive attitude to non-traditional
sexual relationships and would restrict
freedom of expression and the right to
peaceful assembly.
Ethnic Uzbeks in the south of Kyrgyzstan
continued to be vulnerable to physical attacks
based on their ethnic origin. However, the
authorities qualified these attacks as “petty
hooliganism”, and did not fully and impartially
investigate them as alleged hate crimes.
On 4 August 2014, ethnic Uzbek
Kabulzhan Osmonov needed emergency
medical treatment for injuries inflicted by a
224
group of men, described by eyewitnesses as
ethnic Kyrgyz, who assaulted and beat him
unconscious in an unprovoked attack at his
place of work in Osh. They had addressed
him as “sart”, a derogatory term indicating
Uzbek ethnicity. Kabulzhan Osmonov
reported the attack to his local police station
but it was not until the case attracted media
coverage that a criminal investigation was
opened. Following this, local prosecutors
and police pressured Kabulzhan Osmonov to
withdraw his complaint.

LAOS
Lao People’s Democratic Republic
Head of state: Choummaly Sayasone
Head of government: Thongsing Thammavong
State control over the media, judiciary and
political and social institutions continued
to severely restrict freedom of expression,
association and peaceful assembly. Lack
of openness and a scarcity of information
made independent monitoring of the human
rights situation difficult. The enforced
disappearance of a prominent member
of civil society was unresolved at the
end of the year. At least two prisoners of
conscience remained imprisoned. Although
Laos is abolitionist in practice, the death
penalty was retained as a mandatory
punishment for some drug offences.
BACKGROUND
The controversy over the building of large
hydropower dams continued. Dissatisfaction
within the country by those forced to relocate
was reported, with some communities
Amnesty International Report 2014/15challenging loss of land and inadequate
or unpaid compensation. In August Laos
announced a temporary suspension of
construction and a six-month consultation on
its second major dam on the River Mekong
following concerns raised by neighbouring
countries; the consultation process was
reportedly flawed and work on the dam
continued. Environmental groups claimed that
the Xayaburi and Don Sahong hydropower
dams would impact the food security of
around 60 million people downstream. A
further nine dams were planned.
In November Laos submitted its national
report ahead of its review under the UN
Universal Periodic Review in January/
February 2015. The report failed to
adequately address key human rights
concerns raised during the first review in
May 2010.
New proposed guidelines for the operation
and activities of international NGOs working
on development projects were widely
criticized for their heavy approval and
reporting procedures. Similarly, there was
concern that proposed amendments to
the 2009 law regulating local associations
would place further restrictions on civil
society groups.
continued to serve 20-year prison terms. The
authorities stated that two ethnic Hmong
imprisoned in 2003 after a grossly unfair
trial for helping two foreign journalists gather
information were released early: Thao Moua
in 2013 and Pa Fue Khang in May 2014. This
could not be independently confirmed.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
A prominent member of civil society, Sombath
Somphone, 1 remained disappeared since
he was abducted outside a police post in
the capital, Vientiane, in December 2012.
During the year, only one vague public
statement was made by the police about
their investigation and no information was
provided to the family. This compounded
fears that the failure to properly investigate
Sombath Somphone’s abduction or to attempt
to locate him indicated state complicity in
his disappearance, which undermined the
development of an active and confident civil
society. 2

FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Tight restrictions on freedoms of expression,
association and peaceful assembly were
maintained. Draft laws and a decree to
control the use of the internet and social
media were completed by the end of the year.
They included the Cybercrime Law and a
Prime Ministerial Decree on management of
information through the internet. The Decree
enacted aimed to prevent circulation of
criticism of the government and its policies.
Users of Facebook were warned not to post
information that might “disrupt social order
and undermine security”.

LATVIA
Republic of Latvia
Head of state: Andris Berzins
Head of government: Laimdota Straujuma
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex (LGBTI) people were inadequately
protected against hate crimes. While some
positive legislative steps were taken in
2013, the number of stateless people living
225in the country and being excluded from
political rights remained high.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In September, the Parliament adopted
amendments to legislation on hate crime.
However, sexual orientation and gender
identity were not included among the
explicitly protected grounds in the revised
hate crime provisions in the Criminal Code.
Criminal law punished incitement to hatred
and violence based on race, ethnicity,
nationality, religion, disability, age and
sex. Only racist motives were regarded as
aggravating circumstances.
In 2013, the police recorded 22 cases of
violence and incitement to hatred that were
motivated by racism or xenophobia. The
Latvian NGO MOZAIKA reported four cases
of physical attacks against LGBTI people and
one case of assault against a gay man with
a disability.
On 18 September, the Parliament voted to
pass an amendment to the Children’s Rights
Protection law requiring sexuality education
in schools to be based on “traditional family
values” and the concept of “marriage”
defined as being between a man and a
woman only. At the end of the year, the final
adoption of the amendment was pending.
DISCRIMINATION – STATELESS PERSONS
According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR,
267,789 people remained stateless within the
country as of January 2014.
On 1 October 2013, amendments to the
Citizenship Law – aimed at simplifying the
procedure for granting citizenship to a child
born after 21 August 1991 to a non-citizen
or stateless person – were adopted. In April,
the UN Human Rights Committee expressed
concerns over the high number of stateless
people who continued to live in the country
without access to political rights, while
acknowledging progress in this area.
226
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In December 2013, the UN Committee
against Torture highlighted that the definition
of torture included in Article 24 did not
contain all the elements set out in the
Convention against Torture and created
loopholes for impunity. The Committee
expressed concern that torture was not
defined as a specific criminal offence in the
Criminal Code and that some acts of torture or
complicity in perpetrating acts of torture were
subject to a 10-year statute of limitations.
The Committee also pointed to allegations
of violence and ill-treatment perpetrated by
law enforcement agents and highlighted the
absence of an independent mechanism to
investigate such allegations.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Domestic violence was not defined as
a specific crime. In December, the UN
Committee against Torture expressed concern
over the absence of protection measures
and the inadequate provision of shelters for
victims of domestic violence.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In April, the UN Human Rights Committee
expressed concern that the detention of
asylum-seekers, including those as young
as 14, was not just used as a measure of
last resort. The Committee noted that the
non-suspensive effect of appeals of negative
decisions under the accelerated asylum
procedure increased the risk of individuals
being returned to countries where they were
at risk of serious human rights violations
or abuses.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15LEBANON
Lebanese Republic
Head of state: vacant since May, when Michel
Suleiman’s term ended
Head of government: Tammam Salam
Pressures generated by the armed conflict
in neighbouring Syria continued. There were
new reports of torture and other ill-treatment
of detainees. Lebanon hosted more than 1.2
million refugees from Syria but took steps
to restrict the entry of refugees from Syria
including Palestinians. Palestinian refugees
long resident in Lebanon continued to face
discrimination. Women remained subject
to discrimination in law and in practice,
and were inadequately protected against
sexual and other violence. Foreign migrant
workers, particularly women domestic
workers, faced exploitation and other
abuse. More than two dozen men faced
prosecution for alleged consensual same-
sex conduct. Some progress was made in
clarifying cases of enforced disappearance
dating back decades. The death penalty
remained in force; there were no executions.
The trial in their absence of five people in
connection with the assassination of former
Prime Minister Rafic Hariri opened before
the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Syrian
government forces and armed groups based
in Syria carried out indiscriminate attacks
along the border.
BACKGROUND
Political infighting resulted in failure to agree
a new President to replace Michel Suleiman,
whose term of office ended in May. In
February, however, the rival alliances agreed
to form a national unity government with
Tammam Salam as Prime Minister.
Lebanon avoided being drawn fully into
the armed conflict in Syria, despite political,
religious and social divisions, the continuing
influx of refugees from Syria, and the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
participation of some Lebanese persons,
notably members of Hezbollah, in the Syrian
conflict. However, the conflict remained an
ever-present threat.
Political tension remained high throughout
the year, exacerbated by the Syrian conflict.
By the end of the year, Lebanon hosted more
than 1.15 million Syrian refugees and around
50,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria,
swelling the population by a quarter and
straining the country’s resources. Tensions
related to the conflict sparked repeated bouts
of violence, especially in Tripoli, causing
scores of deaths. The Syrian army periodically
shelled the Bekaa valley and other areas
inside Lebanon’s border, and armed groups
fired rockets from Syria into Lebanon’s
eastern border region, where abductions
were also rife. In August, members of the
Islamic State (IS) armed group posted videos
on the internet showing them beheading
two Lebanese soldiers whom they had taken
hostage in fighting around Arsal, a Lebanese
border town briefly seized by IS and other
armed groups including Jabhat al-Nusra,
who reportedly executed two other hostages
in September and December respectively.
A series of bomb attacks in Beirut and
elsewhere also appeared to be connected to
the Syrian conflict.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
There were reports of torture and other ill-
treatment of detained suspects. One detainee
held by General Security in May reported
after his release that interrogators had beaten
him on his hands and legs with electric
cable, trodden on and verbally insulted him.
The authorities failed to undertake credible
investigations into allegations of torture,
including those made by a boy aged 15
and other people detained after clashes
between the Lebanese army and armed
groups in June 2013 in the Sidon area.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Refugees faced restrictions on their right to
seek asylum and other rights. Lebanon was
227not a party to the UN Refugee Convention or
its 1967 Protocol.
At the end of the year, according to
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and
UNWRA, the UN agency for Palestinian
refugees, Lebanon was hosting more than
1.2 million refugees from Syria. In May, the
government effectively closed the border
to most Palestinians entering from Syria,
and announced in June that it would only
allow the entry of Syrian refugees from areas
bordering Lebanon. In October, the authorities
brought in further restrictions and asked
UNHCR to stop registering refugees except
for humanitarian cases. New regulations
announced on 31 December required Syrians
to apply for one of six types of entry visa in
order to enter Lebanon. Instances of Syrian
refugees and Palestinian refugees from
Syria being sent back to Syria, in violation of
international law, were documented.
The high cost of renewing annual residency
permits, combined with opaque policies
for the renewal of permits for refugees
from Syria, led many refugees to become
irregular in status, placing them at risk of
arrest, detention and deportation. Some
municipalities subjected refugees to curfews
that limited their freedom of movement,
prevented refugees from establishing informal
tented settlements, or imposed additional
taxes on local landlords who rented property
to them. The Lebanese army and the Internal
Security Forces also dismantled some
informal tented settlements, ostensibly on
security grounds.
The presence of so many refugees put
Lebanon’s health, education and other
resources under enormous strain. This was
exacerbated by inadequate international
funding, and left many refugees unable
to access adequate health care, shelter,
education and other services.
Thousands of Palestinian long-term
refugees continued to live in camps
and informal gatherings in Lebanon,
often in deprived conditions. They faced
discriminatory laws and regulations, for
228
example denying them the right to inherit
property, the right to work in around 20
professions, and other basic rights.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women faced discrimination in law and in
practice. Personal status laws regulating
issues such as marriage prevented Lebanese
women with foreign spouses passing their
nationality to their children. In April, a new
law specifically criminalized domestic violence
for the first time. Among other deficiencies, it
failed to criminalize marital rape, although it
provided for the establishment of temporary
shelters and measures to strengthen police
and prosecutors’ effectiveness in addressing
domestic violence.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Migrant workers faced exploitation and abuse,
particularly women domestic workers whose
rights at work – including to fixed days off,
rest periods, wages and humane conditions
– were not protected by law, leaving them
vulnerable to physical, sexual and other
abuse by employers. Domestic workers were
employed under contracts tying them to
employers acting as their “sponsors”, under
conditions that facilitated abuse.
Employers frequently retained possession
of workers’ passports to prevent them from
leaving abusive working conditions. In June,
for the first time, a judge ordered an employer
to return a domestic worker’s passport, ruling
that its retention by the employer violated the
worker’s freedom of movement.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Article 534 of the Penal Code, which
prohibited sexual intercourse “contrary to
the order of nature” was used to prosecute
various consensual sexual activities, including
sex between men. In January a judge ruled
that Article 534 was not applicable in the
case of a transgender woman having sexual
relations with men. In August, the authorities
arrested 27 men at a Beirut bath house and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15charged them with offences under Article 534
and provisions relating to “public decency”
and prostitution.
In January, five men arrested on suspicion
of consensual same-sex sexual activity
were reported to have been subjected to
anal examinations by a doctor, despite the
Lebanese Order of Physicians declaring in
2012 that it was impermissible for doctors to
carry out such examinations, which violate the
international prohibition of torture and other
ill-treatment, and a circular from the Minister
of Justice in the same year, that called on
public prosecutors to cease this practice.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Special Tribunal for Lebanon
The trial of four defendants accused in
connection with the assassination of former
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005
opened in January before the Special Tribunal
for Lebanon (STL) in the Netherlands. The
four defendants, and a fifth whose trial was
joined to theirs by the STL in February, all
remained at large and were tried in their
absence. In April, the STL brought contempt
charges against two Lebanese journalists and
their respective media outlets for disclosing
confidential information about witnesses in
the trial of the five accused.
IMPUNITY – ENFORCED
DISAPPEARANCES AND ABDUCTIONS
The fate of thousands who were forcibly
disappeared, abducted or otherwise
unlawfully deprived of their liberty during and
after Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war, mostly
remained undisclosed. In March, however,
the Shura Council ruled that the full, as yet
unpublished, report of the 2000 Official
Committee of Inquiry to Investigate the Fate of
Kidnapped and Missing Persons in Lebanon
should be made available to the families of
those missing. After the dismissal of appeals
against this decision, the full report was
provided to a lawyer representing the families
in September.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Lebanon signed the International
Convention against enforced disappearance
in 2007 but had yet to ratify it.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts continued to impose death sentences
for murder and terrorism-related crimes,
including some in the absence of the
defendants. No executions had been carried
out since 2004.
LIBYA
State of Libya
Head of state: Disputed (Agila Saleh Essa Gweider,
President of the House of Representatives,
replaced Nuri Abu Sahmain, President of the
General National Congress in August)
Head of government: Disputed (Abdallah al-Thinni
replaced Ali Zeidan in March; Ahmad Matiq briefly
replaced Abdallah al-Thinni in May in a disputed
vote ruled unconstitutional; Abdallah al-Thinni
replaced Ahmad Matiq in June)
Militias and other armed forces committed
possible war crimes, other serious violations
of international humanitarian law and
human rights abuses. They killed or injured
hundreds of civilians and destroyed and
damaged civilian infrastructure and objects
in indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas
in Benghazi, Tripoli, Warshafana, Zawiya,
the Nafusa Mountains and elsewhere.
Libya Dawn forces, Zintan Brigades and
Warshafana militias abducted civilians
based on their origin or political affiliation,
tortured and otherwise ill-treated detainees,
and in some cases summarily killed
captured fighters. Islamist forces affiliated
with the Shura Council of Benghazi
Revolutionaries also abducted civilians and
summarily killed scores of captured soldiers.
Operation Dignity forces, which gained
support of the interim government based in
229Tobruk, carried out air strikes in residential
areas causing damage to civilian objects
and resulting in civilian casualties, tortured
or otherwise ill-treated some detained
civilians and fighters, and were responsible
for several summary killings. Political
killings were common and carried out with
impunity; hundreds of security officials,
state employees, religious leaders, activists,
judges, journalists and rights activists were
assassinated. The trial of 37 officials from
the rule of Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi began
amid serious due process concerns; torture
remained rampant; journalists were targeted
for their reporting, and assaults against
foreign nationals increased. Impunity,
including for past human rights violations
and abuses, remained entrenched.
BACKGROUND
Following months of deepening political
polarization and crisis over the legitimacy and
mandate of the General National Congress
(GNC), Libya’s first elected parliament, the
country descended into chaos as Benghazi,
Derna, Tripoli, Warshafana, the Nafusa
Mountains and other areas became engulfed
in armed conflicts along political, ideological,
regional and tribal lines.
Tensions were high at the time of
February elections for a Constitution Drafting
Assembly (CDA), tasked with devising a
new Constitution. The CDA elections were
marred by violence, a boycott by some ethnic
minorities, and a low allocation of seats for
women. By the end of the year, the CDA had
released its preliminary recommendations
and opened them for public consultation.
In May, retired army General Khalifa
Haftar launched Operation Dignity, a military
offensive with the stated aim of fighting
terrorism, in Benghazi, against a coalition
formed of Ansar al-Sharia and other Islamist
armed groups (later named the Shura
Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries). Initially
denounced by the authorities, Operation
Dignity, which subsequently spread to Derna,
gained support from the new government
230
that took office following elections in June
for a House of Representatives (HOR) that
replaced the GNC. These elections, also
marred by violence and a low turnout,
resulted in a defeat for Islamist parties.
In July, a coalition of predominantly
Misratah, Zawiya and Tripoli-based militias
launched a military offensive, Libya Dawn,
in the name of protecting the “17 February
Revolution” against rival militias from Zintan
and Warshafana, affiliated to the liberal and
federalist parties dominating the HOR, which
they accused of carrying out a counter-
revolution alongside Operation Dignity. In
August, the HOR relocated due to insecurity
in Tripoli, establishing its base at Tobruk,
amid a boycott by 30 of its members. It
recognized Operation Dignity as a legitimate
military operation led by the Libyan army,
declared Libya Dawn forces and Ansar
al-Sharia terrorist groups, and called for
foreign intervention to protect civilians and
state institutions. Aircraft from the United
Arab Emirates flying from Egyptian airbases
reportedly carried out air strikes on Libya
Dawn forces as they fought to win control
of Tripoli International Airport, which they
achieved on 23 August, forced the Zintan
Brigades from the capital, and seized control
of state institutions there. The fighting and
associated insecurity, including attacks on
foreign diplomats and staff of international
organizations, led the UN Support Mission
in Libya (UNSMIL), whose mandate the UN
Security Council renewed in March, foreign
embassies and international organizations
to suspend their operations in Tripoli and
evacuate staff. Bombings and other attacks
targeted government buildings and public
places throughout the year.
After capturing Tripoli, Libya Dawn forces
reconvened the GNC, which appointed a
new Prime Minister and National Salvation
Government (NSG). The NSG claimed that
it had taken charge of most state institutions
in the west, in opposition to the HOR
government in Tobruk.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 6 November, the Supreme Court issued
a ruling that invalidated the elections for
the HOR. The Tobruk-based government,
recognized by the UN and backed by most
of the international community, rejected
the ruling, alleging that judges had been
threatened by Libya Dawn. Armed clashes
between rival tribes continued in Sabha
and Obari in southwest Libya leading to a
worsening of the humanitarian situation.
Derna, an eastern city, was controlled by
Islamist armed groups which enforced a strict
interpretation of Shari’a law (Islamic law) and
committed serious human rights abuses. In
October, one armed group based in Derna,
the Shura Council of Islamic Youth, declared
allegiance to the Islamic State armed group
fighting in Syria and Iraq.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
Warring parties in the east and west of
Libya carried out indiscriminate attacks
resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties
and damage to civilian buildings and
infrastructure including hospitals, homes,
mosques, businesses, farms, power stations,
airports, roads and a large fuel storage facility.
They fired artillery, mortars, GRAD rockets
and anti-aircraft weapons from and into
residential areas. Operation Dignity forces
carried out air strikes in Benghazi, Derna,
Tripoli, Zuara, Bir al-Ghanem and Misratah,
at times in residential areas, reportedly
killing and injuring civilians and damaging
civilian buildings. Zintan Brigades allegedly
used antipersonnel mines around Tripoli
International Airport.
The Libya Dawn attack on Zintan Brigades
protecting Tripoli International Airport
damaged several buildings and aircraft,
according to officials. In December, a rocket
hit a large oil tank at al-Sider port resulting in
a fire and destroying up to 1.8 million barrels
of crude oil.
With some exceptions, militias, army
units and armed groups showed disregard
for civilian life, objects and infrastructure
and failed to take the necessary precautions
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
to avoid or minimize civilian casualties
and damage. Heavy fighting in residential
areas caused disruption to health care,
notably in Warshafana and Benghazi, where
patients had to be evacuated from hospitals.
Shortages of fuel, electricity, food and
medicine were reported across Libya.
In Warshafana and Tripoli, Libya Dawn
forces looted and burned civilian homes and
other property on the basis of the owner’s
origin or political affiliation. Armed groups
denied access for humanitarian relief in
Obari and obstructed the evacuation of the
wounded in Kikla.
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency,
estimated that almost 395,000 people were
internally displaced by the conflict between
mid-May and mid-November. The Tawargha
community, displaced since 2011, suffered
further displacement and militia attacks;
many sought shelter in municipal parks and
car parks.
Armed forces on all sides carried out
reprisal abductions, holding civilians solely
on account of their origin or perceived
political affiliation, often as hostages to
secure prisoner exchanges. Both Libya Dawn
forces and armed groups affiliated with the
Zintan-Warshafana coalition tortured and
otherwise ill-treated captured fighters and
civilians they abducted, using electric shocks,
stress positions, and denial of food, water
and adequate washing facilities. Captured
fighters were subjected to summary killings
by all warring parties. In Benghazi, forces
affiliated with the Shura Council of Benghazi
Revolutionaries abducted civilians and carried
out summary killings, including beheadings of
captured soldiers and purported supporters
of Operation Dignity. Groups aligned with
Operation Dignity forces burned and
destroyed scores of homes and other property
of perceived Islamists; detained civilians
on account of their political affiliation; and
carried out several acts of torture and other
ill-treatment and several summary killings.
231UNLAWFUL KILLINGS
Hundreds of individuals, including security
officials, state employees, religious
leaders, activists, journalists, judges and
prosecutors were killed in politically motivated
assassinations in Benghazi, Derna and Sirte
allegedly by Islamist armed groups. None of
those responsible were held to account. In
May, gunmen shot dead an International Red
Cross delegate in Sirte.
In June, human rights lawyer and activist
Salwa Bughaighis was shot dead in her home
after she gave a media interview in which
she accused armed groups of undermining
parliamentary elections. In July unidentified
assailants killed former GNC member Fariha
Barkawi in Derna. On 19 September, known
as Black Friday, at least 10 individuals,
including two youth activists, were killed by
unidentified assailants.
Two public execution-style killings, as well
as public floggings, were carried out by the
Shura Council of Islamic Youth, an armed
group controlling Derna which established an
Islamic Court there. In August, an Egyptian
man accused of theft and murder was shot
dead at a stadium in Derna. In November,
three activists were beheaded in Derna
following their abduction, allegedly by an
Islamist armed group. In December, the
Islamic Court issued a warning to current
and former employees of the Ministries of the
Interior, Justice and Defence.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
The GNC tightened restrictions on freedoms
of expression, association and assembly.
Decree 5/2014, adopted by the GNC in
January, banned satellite television stations
from broadcasting views deemed “hostile to
the 17 February Revolution”, while decree
13/2014 empowered authorities to suspend
the scholarships of students and salaries
of state employees abroad who engaged
in “activities hostile to the 17 February
Revolution”. Law 5/2014 amended Article
195 of the Penal Code to criminalize insults to
232
officials, the state’s emblem and flag, and any
act perceived as “an attack against the 17
February Revolution”.
In January, a court sentenced an engineer
to a three-year prison term for participating in
a June 2011 protest in London, UK, against
NATO’s involvement in the Libyan conflict
and allegedly publishing false information
about Libya.
In November, newspaper editor Amara
al-Khattabi was sentenced to five years in
prison for insulting public officials, barred
from practising journalism and stripped of his
civil rights for the duration of the sentence
and ordered to pay heavy fines. 1
Militias increased their attacks on the
media, abducting scores of journalists and
subjecting others to physical assaults or other
ill-treatment, arbitrary detention, threats
and assassination attempts. At least four
journalists were unlawfully killed, including
newspaper editor Muftah Abu Zeid, who
was shot dead by unidentified armed men
in Benghazi in May. In August, Libya Dawn
forces in Tripoli destroyed and burned the
premises of two TV stations, Al-Assema and
Libya International.
Scores of journalists, human rights
defenders and activists fled abroad because
of the threat posed to them by militias. In
September, Libya Dawn forces reportedly
raided the offices of the National Commission
for Human Rights and removed its archive
of individual complaints, raising concerns of
reprisals against victims of abuses.
In November, the National Council for
Human Rights and Civil Liberties was closed,
reportedly by Libya Dawn forces, amid
intimidation of its members.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The justice system remained paralyzed
by violence and lawlessness, hampering
investigations into abuses. In March, courts
suspended work in Derna, Benghazi and Sirte
amid threats and attacks against judges and
prosecutors. The Ministry of Justice exercised
only nominal control over many detention
Amnesty International Report 2014/15facilities holding perceived Mu’ammar
al-Gaddafi loyalists.
A deadline set by the Law on Transitional
Justice and extended by the GNC, to charge
or release all detainees held in relation to the
2011 conflict by 2 April, was not met. As of
March, only 10% of the 6,200 detainees held
in prisons under the Ministry of Justice had
been tried, while hundreds continued to be
held without charge or trial in poor conditions.
Release orders remained unimplemented due
to militia pressure.
Delays in the processing of cases of
perceived al-Gaddafi loyalists held since
2011 were exacerbated by the renewed
conflicts as shelling prevented the transfer
of detainees for trial. Family visits to prisons
were suspended in several cities, prompting
concern for the detainees’ safety.
The trial of 37 former officials from
Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi’s rule began in
March amid serious due process concerns.
Defence lawyers were denied access to some
evidence, given insufficient time to prepare,
and were intimidated. Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi,
one of Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi’s sons and the
main defendant, appeared in court only by
video link as he remained in militia custody in
Zintan, casting doubt on the court’s authority
over him. Authorities controlling al-Hadba
Prison complex, which hosts the courtroom,
denied access to some independent trial
observers including Amnesty International.
A video of the “confessions” of another
of Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi’s sons, Saadi
al-Gaddafi, was broadcast on Libyan television
following his extradition from Niger and
imprisonment at al-Hadba. Prison authorities
interrogated him without access to a lawyer,
and denied access to him by UNSMIL,
Amnesty International and others, despite the
prosecution authorizing these visits.
In Zawiya, west of Tripoli, scores of
al-Gaddafi loyalists were detained for periods
of up to 18 months beyond the date they
should have been released, as sentencing did
not take into account the period of arbitrary
detention by militias. Torture and other ill-
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
treatment remained widespread in both state
and militia prisons, and deaths in custody
caused by torture continued to be reported.
IMPUNITY
The authorities failed to carry out meaningful
investigations into alleged war crimes and
serious human rights abuses committed
during the 2011 armed conflict or to address
the legacy of past violations under Mu’ammar
al-Gaddafi’s rule, including the 1996 mass
killing of over 1,200 detainees in Abu
Salim Prison.
The authorities failed to surrender Saif
al-Islam al-Gaddafi to the International
Criminal Court (ICC) to face prosecution on
charges of crimes against humanity. In May,
the ICC Appeals Chamber confirmed Libya’s
legal obligation to transfer him to ICC custody.
In July, the ICC Appeals Chamber upheld
a decision that Abdallah al-Senussi, a former
military intelligence chief accused of crimes
against humanity, could be tried domestically.
Serious concerns remained, however, about
violations of his due process rights, including
restricted access to a lawyer of his choice.
The ICC Prosecutor initiated a second
case and began compiling evidence against
suspects residing abroad in accordance
with a 2013 agreement with the Libyan
government on prosecutions of former
al-Gaddafi officials. Despite expressing
concern in November that “crimes within the
ICC jurisdiction are being committed”, the ICC
Prosecutor failed to begin investigations into
crimes committed by militias.
In August, UN Security Council Resolution
2174 extended the scope for international
sanctions to include those responsible
for “planning, directing, or committing”
violations of international human rights law
or international humanitarian law, or human
rights abuses, in Libya.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women continued to face discrimination in
law and practice, and were inadequately
protected against gender-based violence;
233reports of sexual harassment increased. A
decree providing for reparations to victims
of sexual violence by state agents under
Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi’s rule and during the
2011 conflict was adopted but remained
largely unimplemented.
Women candidates to the CDA faced
difficulties in campaigning and registering
to vote.
Women’s rights activists faced intimidation
and in some cases assault by militias.
Unveiled women were increasingly stopped,
harassed and threatened at checkpoints.
Several women were reported to have been
killed by male relatives in so-called “honour
killings” in the Sabha area.
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Thousands of undocumented migrants,
asylum-seekers and refugees were detained
indefinitely for migration-related offences
following their interception at sea or identity
checks. They faced torture and other ill-
treatment in detention centres run by the
Ministry of the Interior and militias, including
on account of their religion, and were
subjected to forced labour. Women faced
intrusive strip-searches by male guards.
Foreign nationals, in particular Egyptian
Copts, were abducted, abused and unlawfully
killed on account of their religious beliefs.
In February, seven Egyptian Coptic migrant
workers were abducted and shot dead in
Benghazi, allegedly by members of Ansar
al-Sharia.
The authorities continued to subject foreign
nationals to compulsory medical tests as a
prerequisite for issuing residency and work
permits, and detained anyone diagnosed with
infections such as hepatitis B or C and HIV in
preparation for deportation.
Foreign nationals faced abductions
and abuse for ransom. Many were victims
of human trafficking by smugglers upon
irregular entry into Libya.
The escalation of violence impelled some
130,000 refugees and migrants, including
refugees from Syria, to travel to Italy via
234
unseaworthy and overcrowded fishing
boats. Many spent weeks locked in houses
by smugglers prior to departure and were
exploited, coerced and abused. Smugglers
forced sub-Saharan Africans to travel below
deck in overheated engine rooms without
water or ventilation; some died of suffocation
or intoxication with fumes.
UNHCR reported in mid-November that
14,000 registered refugees and asylum-
seekers were trapped in conflict zones
in Libya.
DISCRIMINATION – RELIGIOUS
AND ETHNIC MINORITIES
Attacks on Sufi religious sites continued while
the authorities failed to provide adequate
protection or conduct investigations.
Sufi tombs were destroyed in Tripoli,
Brak al-Shatti, Derna and Awjila. In July,
unidentified assailants In Tripoli abducted
Tarek Abbas, a Sufi imam; he was released
in December.
Libyan atheists and agnostics faced threats
and intimidation from militias in relation to
their writings on social networking websites.
Tabu and Tuareg ethnic minorities
continued to face obstacles in acquiring
family identity booklets, hindering their
access to health care, education and political
participation.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty remained in force for a
wide range of crimes. No judicial executions
were reported.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15LITHUANIA
Republic of Lithuania
Head of state: Dalia Grybauskaitė
Head of government: Algirdas Butkevičius
In February, the Prosecutor General opened
an investigation into allegations that a
Saudi Arabian national had been subjected
to illegal rendition to Lithuania by the US
CIA with the help of Lithuanian intelligence
officials. A law, which aimed at “protecting
minors” against detrimental public
information, resulted in violations of the
right to freedom of expression of lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex
(LGBTI) people.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
In January, the Vilnius Regional Court
ruled that the Lithuanian Prosecutor
General’s refusal to launch a pre-trial
investigation into allegations that Saudi
Arabian national Mustafa al-Hawsawi had
been illegally transferred to and detained
in a CIA detention centre at Antaviliai,
near Vilnius, had been “groundless”. Legal
representatives for Mustafa al-Hawsawi
had complained that he was tortured and
subjected to enforced disappearance in
Lithuania between 2004 and September
2006. In February, the Prosecutor General
opened a pre-trial investigation focusing on
Mustafa al-Hawsawi’s alleged illegal transfer
to Lithuania.
The Prosecutor General had previously
refused to investigate similar allegations
by lawyers for Palestinian Zayn al- Abidin
Muhammad Husayn ( known as Abu
Zubaydah ) . Abu Zubaydah’s case
against Lithuania was pending before the
European Court of Human Rights at the
end of the year . Both Mustafa al- Hawsawi
and Abu Zubaydah remained held at
Guantánamo Bay.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In May, the UN Committee against
Torture urged the government to complete
the investigation into Mustafa al-Hawsawi’s
alleged rendition in a timely and transparent
manner. In the aftermath of the release in
December of a US Senate report on CIA
secret detention that contained references
to “detention site violet”, widely believed
to have been located in Lithuania, it was
reported that the Lithuanian authorities were
seeking additional information from the USA
to determine whether detainees had been
held and tortured in Lithuania. Information
in the Senate report regarding “detention site
violet” conformed with a 2009 Lithuanian
parliamentary inquiry that had concluded
that the CIA had established two secret sites
in Lithuania.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In May, the Office of the Inspector of
Journalist Ethics concluded a book of fairy
tales, which included stories of same-sex
relationships, opposed “traditional family
values”, as protected by the Law on the
Protection of Minors against the Detrimental
Effects of Public Information. The book’s
distribution was stopped.
In September, the Office of the Inspector
of Journalist Ethics found a video promoting
tolerance towards LGBTI people and
portraying same-sex families violated the Law
on the Protection of Minors.
Transgender people continued to be denied
access to legal gender recognition because of
legislative gaps. Two proposals were pending
before the parliament: one aimed at banning
legal gender recognition, the other at allowing
transgender people to seek legal recognition
of their gender under certain compulsory
conditions, including reassignment surgery.

tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons.
On 6 July, further protests took place. In
the predominantly Albanian cities of Tetovo
and Gostivar, police used tear gas and stun
grenades. Six men were sentenced to three
years’ imprisonment for “participation in a
crowd to commit a crime”.
Human rights were increasingly curtailed.
Relations between the Macedonian and
ethnic Albanian populations were marred by
violent protests. New details emerged about
the rendition of a CIA detainee with the
complicity of Macedonia. CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW
BACKGROUND COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The ruling party, Internal Macedonian
Revolutionary Organization – Democratic
Party for Macedonian National Unity,
remained in power following parliamentary
elections in May, which were not recognized
by the main opposition party. Freedom of
expression was increasingly curtailed. The
authorities exercised excessive influence over
the police and judiciary. While the European
Commission again recommended that talks
on EU accession should start, in December
the EU Council of Ministers for the sixth time
deferred the decision.
Relations between Macedonians and
ethnic Albanians remained precarious. In
May, the arrest of an ethnic Albanian student,
suspected of killing a Macedonian student,
triggered two days of inter-ethnic rioting in
the Gorce Petrov municipality of Skopje,
the capital.
On 30 June, six ethnic Albanians were
convicted – two in their absence – of murder
defined as “terrorism” for the killing of five
ethnic Macedonians near Lake Smilkovci
in April 2012, and sentenced to life
imprisonment; one defendant was acquitted.
On 4 July, thousands of Albanians
marched into the centre of Skopje, saying
“We are not terrorists”. The peaceful
demonstration escalated outside the High
Court with riot police using excessive force
against protesters, including rubber bullets, The December release of a US Senate
report on CIA secret detention operations
included confirmation that former detainee
Khaled el-Masri’s 2003 apprehension by
the Macedonian authorities was a case of
mistaken identity and the CIA took measures
to cover up the incident. The European Court
of Human Rights ruled in a 2013 landmark
judgment that Macedonia was liable for
Khaled el-Masri's incommunicado detention,
enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-
treatment, for his transfer out of Macedonia to
locations where the German national suffered
other serious violations of his human rights,
and for the failure to carry out an effective
investigation.
At the end of the year, the authorities had
failed to submit to the Committee of Ministers
an action plan, overdue since October 2013,
to implement the Court’s judgment.
236
Impunity continued for war crimes and crimes
against humanity which occurred during the
2001 internal armed conflict. No measures
were taken to locate the bodies of 13 persons
still missing after the armed conflict.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Allegations against police officials continued,
including disproportionately against Roma. In
May, two Roma minors, wrongly suspected
of stealing a purse, were beaten by members
of the Alfi Special Police unit. The older
child was interrogated in a police station for
two hours in the absence of a lawyer or his
parents, and suffered bruising to his head,
neck and chest.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In April, the UN Special Rapporteur
on freedom of expression criticized the
deterioration of freedom of expression,
pluralism and media independence. The
government reportedly spent 1% of its
budget on placing advertisements in, or
otherwise favouring, pro-government media.
International organizations reported that state
media election coverage was biased towards
the ruling party.
During the May riots, police seized
equipment from three media outlets and
erased their video footage. Politicians
continued to file defamation cases against
journalists. International and domestic
organizations called for the Nova Makedonija
journalist Tomislav Kezharovski to be
released from house arrest. He was originally
imprisoned in 2013 for revealing the identity
of an alleged protected witness, in what
was considered to be a politically motivated
prosecution. After international protests, he
was released into house arrest.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
The authorities failed to prevent, and protect
Roma from, multiple forms of discrimination.
Action plans for the Decade of Roma
Inclusion and recommendations on the rights
of Roma women made in 2013 by the UN
CEDAW Committee were not implemented.
In June, the Constitutional Court ruled
that articles of the Law on Travel Documents,
enabling the authorities to revoke the
passports of Macedonian citizens who had
been returned or deported from another
country, were incompatible with the right
to freedom of movement. This followed a
complaint by the NGO European Roma
Rights Centre on behalf of Roma who
experienced disproportionate discrimination
by border officials.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
grounds of sexual orientation. LGBTI human
rights defenders were subject to regular
threats. In October, 30 young men attacked
a celebration of the second anniversary of
the LGBTI Centre in Skopje, seriously injuring
two people; no one has yet been brought to
justice. In July the government proposed a
constitutional amendment defining marriage
as solely between a man and a woman.
REFUGEES, ASYLUM-
SEEKERS AND MIGRANTS
Around 850 Kosovo Roma and Ashkali
refugees remained in Macedonia, without a
durable solution. By the end of September,
7,105 Macedonian citizens had applied for
asylum in the EU.
Around 440 of the 1,260 registered
asylum-seekers applied for asylum in
Macedonia, but only 10 Syrians were granted
refugee status and one person was granted
subsidiary protection. Migrants, including
women and unaccompanied minors, and
Syrian refugees were detained in appalling
conditions. Border guards were complicit in
push-backs from Serbia.
MALAWI
Republic of Malawi
Head of state and government: Arthur Peter
Mutharika (replaced Joyce Banda in May)
Those responsible for the deaths of two
students in 2011 and 2012 were not
brought to justice. Homosexuality continued
to be criminalized under the penal code,
although commitments were made to
decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual
activity. Death sentences continued to be
imposed; no executions were carried out.
Anti-discrimination legislation was not
amended to prohibit discrimination on the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
237BACKGROUND
Controversy surrounded the general elections
held on 20 May, with the then President
Joyce Banda attempting to have the
elections nullified, alleging fraud. However,
opposition candidate Arthur Peter Mutharika’s
Democratic Progressive Party was declared
the winning party following a High Court
ruling. The new government faced perennial
problems of deepening poverty, poor service
delivery, mass unemployment, limited
access to justice, gender-based violence and
child marriages.
During the “hunger season” prior to the
2014 harvest, more than 1.4 million people in
rural areas were at risk of malnutrition.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
In July, Malawi appeared before the UN
Human Rights Committee for consideration
of the country’s first periodic report under the
ICCPR. Among other things, the Committee
recommended the amendment of Malawi’s
Human Rights Commission Act to give the
Commission full independence in line with
the UN Paris Principles. The Committee also
recommended that Malawi adopt the Prison
Act in conformity with international standards;
strengthen the capacity and independence
of the Inspectorate of Prisons and establish
mechanisms to consistently consider its
recommendations and make them public;
and facilitate complaints from detainees.
2011, remained unresolved, despite the
2012 recommendations of the Chasowa
Commission Report which named
some suspects.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Despite commitments by the previous and
current governments that arrests of adults
engaged in consensual same-sex sexual
activity would be suspended, two men
faced charges under the country’s anti-
homosexuality laws. The two men, who were
arrested in May, were on remand at the end
of the year. If convicted, they would face up to
14 years’ imprisonment with hard labour.
In July, Solicitor General and Secretary
for Justice Dr Janet Banda told the Human
Rights Committee that while homosexual acts
remained criminalized, such acts were not
prosecuted by law enforcement agencies. She
also reported that a process for the Malawi
Law Commission to review the penal laws
criminalizing same-sex acts had stalled largely
due to financial constraints. Specifically, the
Law Commission had been asked to give an
opinion on the constitutionality of Articles
137A, 153 and 156 of the Penal Code,
criminalizing homosexuality.
DEATH PENALTY
Death sentences continued to be imposed; no
executions had been carried out since 1994.
IMPUNITY
Three police officers facing charges of
manslaughter following the death in custody
of Edson Msiska on 29 January 2012 in
Mzuzu were discharged in July after state
prosecutors failed to appear in court; no
reason was given for their failure to appear.
The charges were reinstated in August. Edson
Msiska, a college student, died in suspicious
circumstances four days after his arrest for
alleged possession of stolen property.

MALAYSIA
Malaysia
Head of state: King Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah
Head of government: Najib Tun Razak
Freedom of expression came under attack
as the government increasingly used the
Sedition Act to arrest and charge human
rights defenders and opposition politicians.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Reports of human rights violations by
the police persisted, including deaths in
custody, torture and other ill-treatment, and
unnecessary and excessive use of force and
firearms. Religious minorities and LGBTI
people faced harassment and intimidation.
The death penalty continued to be imposed,
with executions reportedly carried out
in secret.
BACKGROUND
In September Malaysia was elected to serve
a two-year term on the UN Security Council.
Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim faced five
years in prison and a ban from political office
after his acquittal on politically motivated
criminal “sodomy” charges was overturned by
the Court of Appeal in March. 1 Also in March,
Malaysia rejected key recommendations
aimed at strengthening respect for and
protection of human rights at the adoption
of its Universal Periodic Review by the UN
Human Rights Council in Geneva. 2
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Freedom of expression was subject to severe
restrictions under a range of repressive
laws. In August, the authorities began a
crackdown on freedom of expression, using
the Sedition Act to investigate, charge and
imprison human rights defenders, opposition
politicians, a journalist, academics and
students. 3 At least two people were convicted
of sedition during the year and sentenced
to 10 and 12 months’ imprisonment
respectively, while at least 16 others faced
charges by the end of the year. Many more
were investigated under the Act, creating a
chilling effect on free speech. In November,
the Prime Minister reneged on his 2012
promise to repeal the Sedition Act, and
instead announced plans to expand its
scope. 4
Human rights defenders faced intimidation
and harassment because of their work, while
the government persisted in its attempts
to undermine civil society. Lena Hendry,
a human rights defender with the NGO
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Pusat KOMAS, continued to face politically
motivated criminal charges under the 2002
Film Censorship Act for screening the film
No fire zone: The killing fields of Sri Lanka in
July 2013.
Media outlets and publishing houses
faced sweeping restrictions under the
Printing Presses and Publications Act. The
Act required that licences be obtained for
print publications, which could be arbitrarily
revoked by the Home Minister. Independent
media outlets in particular faced difficulty
in obtaining licences under the Act. Civil
defamation suits were used by government
officials and politicians in attempts to
suppress criticism by media. 5
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Police faced persistent allegations of
human rights violations, including deaths in
custody, torture and other ill-treatment, 6 and
unnecessary and excessive use of force and
firearms. In August the Court of Appeal found
the Inspector General of Police and two police
officers responsible under civil law for the
death of A. Kugan, who died in police custody
in 2009. 7 At least 13 people were known to
have died in police custody during 2014.
Investigations into human rights violations
by the police were rare, and suspected
perpetrators were seldom held to account.
The government continued to reject
calls to establish an Independent Police
Complaints and Misconduct Commission
as recommended in the 2005 report of the
Royal Commission.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
The authorities continued to use the
Prevention of Crime Act (PCA) and the
Security Offences (Special Measures) Act
to arbitrarily arrest and detain scores of
individuals suspected of criminal activities.
The PCA, which was amended in 2013,
allows for indefinite, preventive detention
without charge or trial and undermines key
fair trial rights.
239DISCRIMINATION DEATH PENALTY
Instances of religious intolerance, as well as
restrictions on the right to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion, increased during
the year. The authorities increasingly used
religion as a justification for discrimination
against minority religious groups. In June the
Federal Court rejected an appeal seeking
to overturn a ban preventing a Christian
newspaper from using the world “Allah” in its
publications. The authorities had claimed that
the use of the word in non-Muslim literature
was confusing and could cause Muslims
to convert. The ban led to intimidation and
harassment of Christians, including raids on
places of worship by government authorities,
and the seizure of books, videos and other
materials. Other religious minority groups,
including the Shi’a, faced intimidation and
threats of criminalization, while civil society
groups and human rights organizations also
faced harassment and intimidation from both
authorities and certain religious groups.
In a landmark decision, in November the
Court of Appeal ruled that a Negeri Sembilan
Shari’a law making cross-dressing illegal was
inconsistent with the Constitution. However,
reports were received during the year about
the arrest and imprisonment of lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and intersex people
purely on the basis of their sexuality, and they
continued to face discrimination, both in law
and practice. In February and March respectively,
following national and international criticism,
the executions of Chandran Paskaran
and Osariakhi Ernest Obayangbon were
postponed. They had not been executed
by the end of the year. 8 However, death
sentences continued to be imposed and
reports indicated that executions were carried
out in a secretive manner, without prior or
posthumous announcements.

REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Malaysia violated the international prohibition
against refoulement by forcibly returning
refugees and asylum-seekers to countries
where they faced serious human rights
violations. In May, the authorities forcibly
returned two refugees and one asylum-seeker
– all of them under the protection of UNHCR,
the UN refugee agency – to Sri Lanka where
they faced possible torture and other-ill-
treatment.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15MALDIVES
Republic of Maldives
Head of state and government: Abdulla Yameen
Abdul Gayoom
Preparations to resume executions put
at risk the lives of at least 20 people on
death row. Judicial flogging continued and
the majority of those flogged were women.
The government failed to bring to justice
vigilantes who used violence against people
promoting religious tolerance. Impunity
continued for police and army officers
responsible for unnecessary or excessive use
of force.
BACKGROUND
Parliamentary elections took place in March
and parties allied to the President won a
majority. In April, the parliament adopted
a new Penal Code, due to come into force
in 2015.
DEATH PENALTY
The country was preparing to resume
executions after more than 60 years. In April,
the government introduced “procedural
regulations on investigating and penalizing
the crime of murder” under the Police Act
and Clemency Act, clearing the way for
executions to be carried out. The regulations
also contained new procedures relating
to the execution of individuals who were
below 18 years old when the crime was
committed, allowing for them to be executed
once they turned 18. Two people were
sentenced to death by the Juvenile Court for
crimes committed when the offenders were
under 18.
CRUEL, INHUMAN OR
DEGRADING PUNISHMENT
People continued to be sentenced to flogging
following convictions for having had sex
outside marriage. Media reports and human
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
rights defenders said that in the majority
of cases, only women were convicted and
flogged. The Office of the Prosecutor General
told Amnesty International that convictions
were primarily based on confessions. If the
accused denied the allegations, the charge
of “fornication” was dropped. They said men
usually denied the allegations and were not
charged. This was also true for some women,
unless they had become pregnant or were
under pressure from their communities to
admit to the allegations.
Amnesty International spoke with a
woman in 2013 who had been convicted of
“fornication”. She had been sentenced to
20 lashes and four months in prison in June
2012, when she was 17 years old. She said
someone witnessed her having sex with her
boyfriend and reported it to the police, after
which she was arrested and taken to the
Juvenile Court where she confessed. The
woman said that this was the second time
she had been flogged – the first time she
was just 14 years old. She said that flogging
was always carried out by a man and she
described her experience: “It was very painful
when they flogged me. I was bruised and had
marks on my body for some time.” Following
the flogging she was sent to prison.
FREEDOMS OF RELIGION
AND EXPRESSION
No one was brought to justice for the stabbing
and serious wounding of religious freedom
advocate Ismail “Hilath” Rasheed in 2012.
He had also been attacked in 2011.
In June, an Islamist vigilante group
abducted several young men, held them
for hours, ill-treated them and warned them
not to promote “atheism”. None of the
perpetrators were brought to justice.
In August, Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, a
well-known journalist with Minivan News,
disappeared, possibly by force. He was last
seen in the early hours of 8 August on the
Malé-Hulhumalé ferry. There were national
and international calls on the authorities
to do more to uncover his whereabouts.
241He had been investigating, among other
things, the activities of vigilante Islamist
groups. His possible enforced disappearance
was believed to be linked to his work as
a journalist.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
The government did not confirm whether it
was investigating police officers who had used
unnecessary force against youths peacefully
attending a private music festival in April.
Police ransacked their belongings, held 79
youths in handcuffs overnight and ill-treated
some of them. One participant said she was
kicked hard in the back by a policeman
and another was sprayed with pepper spray
without any provocation.
IMPUNITY
No police or army officers were brought
to justice for beating and injuring dozens
of members and leaders of the Maldivian
Democratic Party in February 2012.
MALI
Republic of Mali
Head of state: Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta
Head of government: Moussa Mara (replaced
Oumar Tatam Ly in April)
Internal armed conflict continued to create a
climate of persistent insecurity, particularly
in the north of the country. Armed groups
committed abuses including abductions and
killings. The authorities were slow to take
action against those who committed human
rights violations during the 2012 conflict.
BACKGROUND
Although a peace agreement was signed
between the Malian government and several
armed groups in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, in June 2013, the north of the country
242
remained unstable, with parts of it beyond the
control of the Malian authorities.
Violent clashes continued to erupt between
armed groups and the Malian army in
Kidal in May, in which at least 41 people,
including eight civilians, were killed. Peace
discussions continued in Algeria between the
Malian government and armed groups, but
outbreaks of violence persisted. There were
repeated incidents of rocket attacks, mines
and explosive devices in the north injuring
and killing Malian and international military
personnel. Between May and September,
the UN Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)
was repeatedly attacked by armed groups.
In October, nine Nigerian UN peacekeepers
were killed when their convoy was ambushed
by an armed group between the towns of
Menaka and Ansongo in the Gao region of
northeastern Mali.
In March, the National Assembly approved
a law creating a commission for truth, justice
and reconciliation. It also created a high court
of justice to try officials suspected of treason
and crimes during their terms in office.
Issaka Sidibé was elected President of
the National Assembly in January. In April,
Prime Minister Oumar Tatam Ly resigned and
President Keïta named Moussa Mara the new
Prime Minister.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Investigations continued into the killings of
two Radio France Internationale journalists,
Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon, after
they were abducted in Kidal in November
2013. Both the French and Malian authorities
opened judicial inquiries.
Five Malian staff of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were
taken hostage in February and held until
April. The armed group Movement for
Oneness and Jihad in West Africa claimed
responsibility for the abductions.
In May, members of armed groups
deliberately killed eight male civilians,
including six government officials, at the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Governor’s office in Kidal, northern Mali.
They also took 30 people hostage including
government employees from the Governor’s
office, some of whom were beaten. The
hostages were released on their third day
of captivity after negotiations with UN
peacekeeping forces. 1
In September, five men from the Tuareg
tribe were abducted by an armed group in the
market in Zouéra, a town situated 80km north
of the city of Timbuktu. Four were released a
few days later but Hama Ag-Sidi Ahmed was
beheaded. His head was found suspended
at the marketplace in Zouéra; his decapitated
body was found under a tree in the centre of
the town.
Serge Lazarevic, a French hostage
abducted in November 2011 in Hombori,
Mopti region, was released in November.
Three people from the same family were
reportedly abducted near the town of Menaka
in December.
IMPUNITY
The government began to tackle the issue of
impunity and made some progress, notably
in the case of the enforced disappearance
of more than 20 soldiers in April 2012. An
investigation into these disappearances began
in March. A total of 28 people were arrested
during the year, including General Amadou
Sanogo, leader of the military junta that ruled
Mali for part of 2012, and General Ibrahim
Dahirou Dembélé, former Chief of Staff. All
were charged with murder and complicity
in kidnapping.
Few prosecutions were brought in
connection with other cases of enforced
disappearances and there were long delays
in bringing to justice those responsible for
committing human rights violations in the
context of the conflict. Some cases, notably
the disappearance of 11 men in Timbuktu in
February 2013, were yet to be investigated.
imprisoned alongside adults without access
to family or legal counsel. 2 In mid-2014, at
least seven children were detained in the
capital, Bamako, alongside adults, without
protection measures for children in custody.
Most were charged with being members of
armed groups and with the illegal possession
of firearms and ammunitions. Four were
released in August but other children
remained in detention.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
At least seven people arrested in connection
with the conflict died in custody between
January 2012 and the end of 2014. At
least two such detainees died in custody in
Bamako during 2014 due to lack of medical
care; Mohamed Ag Sana died in March and
Ismagel Ag Achkou in May.
DEATH PENALTY
No executions had been carried out in Mali
for several decades, but death sentences
continued to be imposed. In August, Bassidiki
Touré, Souleymane Diarra, Soumaila Dembélé
and Almamy Traoré were sentenced to death
for robbery and complicity. Sounkodjan Diarra
was sentenced to death for premeditated
murder. His co-accused was sentenced to life
imprisonment.

243MALTA
Republic of Malta
Head of state: Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca
Head of government: Joseph Muscat
Malta maintained a restrictive interpretation
of search and rescue obligations at sea.
The authorities continued to automatically
detain asylum-seekers and migrants, in
breach of international standards, and to
deny them effective remedies to challenge
their detention. Same-sex couples were
granted the same rights as heterosexuals in
a civil marriage. Constitutional protection
was extended to cover discrimination on
grounds of sexual orientation and gender
identity. Abortion remained prohibited under
all circumstances.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Malta experienced a drop in irregular boat
arrivals of refugees and migrants due to
Italy’s Operation Mare Nostrum during which
refugees and migrants were being rescued at
sea and disembarked on Italian territory. By
the end of September, 565 people had been
rescued and brought to Malta (compared to
2,008 people in 2013). Malta continued to
apply a restrictive interpretation of search and
rescue obligations at sea, aimed at limiting
disembarkation of refugees and migrants in
its territory. 1
The authorities continued to automatically
detain undocumented migrants, often for up
to 18 months, and asylum-seekers, for up to
12 months, in breach of Malta’s international
human rights obligations. On 30 March,
the Prime Minister publicly pledged to end
migrant children’s detention. However,
children and other vulnerable people
continued to be routinely detained as well as
unaccompanied minors detained alongside
adults while awaiting the outcome of their age
or vulnerability assessment. 2
244
Appeal procedures to challenge
the length and lawfulness of detention
remained in breach of international human
rights standards, leaving asylum-seekers
and migrants exposed to the risk of
arbitrary detention.
Conditions in detention cent res remained
sub-standard, with many asylum-seekers and
migrants experiencing lack of privacy and
poor recreation and leisure facilities.
The government refused to disclose
information about the search and rescue
operation regarding a trawler carrying
over 400 people, mostly Syrian families,
which sank on 11 October 2013. Survivors’
testimonies and available data indicated that
rescue may have been delayed due to failures
by Maltese and Italian authorities.
In December, after a two year delay, the
government published , the findings of the
inquiry into the death of Mamadou Kamara,
a 32-year-old Malian national, who died in
custody in June 2012 . He had attempted to
escape from Safi Barracks detention centre
and was allegedly severely ill-treated when
recaptured. The inquiry report recommended
a review of the asylum-seekers and migrants
detention system.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
On 14 April, the Parliament passed the Civil
Unions Act, granting same-sex couples the
same rights as heterosexual couples in a civil
marriage. Partners in a civil union were also
allowed to jointly adopt children, with the
same rights and obligations as parents in a
civil marriage.
On the same day, Parliament amended
the Constitution to include protection
from discrimination on grounds of sexual
orientation and gender identity.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Abortion remained prohibited under all
circumstances, including to save the life
of the woman. In October, the UN Human
Rights Committee, considering Malta
Amnesty International Report 2014/15under the ICCPR, raised concern about the
compatibility of the prohibition with the right
to life.

MAURITANIA
Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Head of state: General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz
Head of government: Yahya Ould Hademine
(replaced Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf in
August)
Torture and other ill-treatment were
routinely used to extract confessions from
detainees and as punishment in prisons.
Slavery persisted, with generations of
families, particularly women and girls, being
held in slavery. The authorities restricted
freedoms of expression and assembly, and
human rights defenders faced harassment
and intimidation.
BACKGROUND
President Aziz was re-elected for a second
five-year term in June, obtaining more than
80% of the vote. The Independent National
Electoral Commission received complaints
contesting this result from four other
candidates. President Aziz was also elected
to serve as President of the AU for one year
in January.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Prisoners of all ages, status and gender were
at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
Women, children, homosexual prisoners,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
political prisoners and prisoners convicted
of common law offences told Amnesty
International that they were subjected to
torture and other ill-treatment by security
forces. Although mainly used to extract
“confessions” from detainees, torture
and other ill-treatment were also used as
punishment in prison. The use of torture was
facilitated by laws which allowed detainees to
be held in police custody for up to 45 days on
suspicion of national security offences. This
limit was regularly exceeded. No action was
taken when complaints of torture were made
to judges or the police.
Reported torture methods included regular
beatings, including beatings with batons;
beatings on the back with the hands and
feet handcuffed behind the back; enforced
squatting for long periods; and having an
iron bar placed between the knees and being
suspended from two water barrels. Detainees
reported being made to sign statements
under threat without being allowed to
read them.
SLAVERY
Despite the adoption of laws criminalizing
slavery and the creation in December 2013
of a special tribunal to hear slavery cases,
implementation in practice remained poor.
Court cases were subject to long delays.
Between 2010 and the end of 2014, at least
six cases of slavery were submitted to the
Public Prosecutor, but no ruling had been
made by the end of 2014.
A strategy to eradicate slavery was
adopted by the government in March. Its
29 recommendations included amending
the 2007 law against slavery to include
further forms of slavery such as hereditary
slavery, debt bondage and early marriage.
It also recommended that the 2007 law
should include provisions for reintegration
programmes for people freed from slavery,
and called for initiatives to raise awareness
that slavery is a criminal offence.
In May, a complaint was filed against a
slaveholder in the Echemin region for the
245enslavement of a 15-year-old girl, MBeirika
Mint M’Bareck. The slaveholder was charged
with exploitation of a minor, but human
rights organizations called for the charges
to be changed to slavery. When MBeirika
Mint M’Bareck was freed in June, the Public
Prosecutor charged her with Zina (unlawful
sexual intercourse) as she was pregnant. The
charge was later dropped. At the end of the
year, her mother and two sisters were still
being held in slavery in the town of Azamat,
near the border with Mali.
Also in May, a woman and her five
children were reported to be held in slavery
in Ould Ramy, near Wembou in southeastern
Mauritania, by the anti-slavery organization
Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist
Movement in Mauritania (IRA). The case was
transferred to the police, who questioned the
representatives of IRA, claiming they were
an unrecognized organization. Gendarmes
were sent to investigate but no progress was
reported by the end of the year.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION
AND ASSEMBLY
The rights to freedom of assembly
and freedom of expression were
repeatedly curtailed.
In March there were demonstrations in
several cities including Nouakchott, Kiffa
and Aioun against an act of desecration of
the Qur’an by unidentified men. Security
forces in Nouakchott used tear gas, resulting
in numerous injuries and the death by
suffocation of one student demonstrator.
The government closed several Islamic
health and education charities and sealed
their offices in March. No official explanation
was offered but the government accused
these organizations of working outside the
bounds of their missions.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders and other activists
faced harassment and intimidation, including
death threats. Police and judicial authorities
246
failed to bring the perpetrators of these acts
to justice.
IRA member Cheikh Ould Vall was arrested
in February without a warrant. He was held
for three days, released and rearrested a
week later, reportedly for assisting his mother
in a court case over a land dispute. He was
sentenced to one year in prison in April, with
six months suspended. He was due to be
released in August, but remained in detention
at the end of the year.
In June, Aminetou Mint El Moctar,
President of the Women’s Association of
Heads of Household, faced a fatwa (religious
decree) including death threats. No action
was known to have been taken by the
authorities to investigate these threats. 1 The
threats came after Aminetou Mint El Moctar
called for a fair trial for Cheikh Ould Mkheitir,
who had been arrested in January for
publishing an allegedly blasphemous article
and was detained in Nouadhibou Prison
in northern Mauritania. He was charged
with apostasy and faced the death penalty
if convicted.
In September and November, at least 10
anti-slavery activists, including Biram Ould
Dah Ould Abeid, President of the IRA, were
arrested in Nouakchott and Rosso. At the
end of the year, the activists were detained
in different detention centres around the
country, facing charges including public
disorder. 2
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Of the 14 men convicted of terrorism-related
offences who were victims of enforced
disappearance in 2011, one died in detention
in May, while the other 13 were transferred to
Nouakchott central prison in May and July.
Maarouf Ould Haiba, sentenced to death
in 2010 for the murder of French tourists and
then held incommunicado, died in detention
in the unofficial detention centre Salah Eddin
in May. He was transferred to a military
hospital several times before his death. The
circumstances of his death remained unclear
and no investigation was opened. Salah
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Eddin, situated in the north of the country,
was closed in July. The remaining prisoners
were transferred to the central prison
in Nouakchott.

MEXICO
United Mexican States
Head of state and government: Enrique Peña Nieto
There were new reports of enforced
disappearances, extrajudicial executions
and torture in the context of violent crime
and lack of accountability in the police
and military. Impunity for human rights
violations and ordinary crimes remained the
norm. More than 22,000 people remained
abducted, forcibly disappeared or missing,
according to official records, including
43 students from Guerrero state. Search
efforts for missing people were generally
ineffective. Reports of torture and other
ill-treatment continued to be widespread,
as was the failure on the part of federal
and state prosecutors to adequately
investigate complaints. The Supreme Court
strengthened legal obligations to exclude
evidence obtained under torture. Many
human rights violations continued to be
attributed to soldiers and navy marines, who
continued to be deployed widely to carry
out law enforcement operations including
combating organized crime. Military
jurisdiction over human rights violations
committed by military personnel against
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
civilians was abolished after decades of
campaigning by victims and civil society
organizations. Human rights defenders
and journalists were harassed, threatened
or killed. Some faced politically motivated
criminal charges. Irregular migrants
in transit faced the threat of murder,
abduction, extortion, sexual violence
and human trafficking; perpetrators were
rarely brought to justice. Despite laws to
combat violence against women, gender-
based violence was routine in many states.
Development and resource exploitation
projects in different parts of the country
affecting Indigenous communities led
to protests and demands for adequate
consultation and consent.
BACKGROUND
The government continued its programme of
legislative reforms affecting the energy sector,
education, telecommunications and political
organization. Despite publishing a National
Human Rights Program, there was little
evidence of substantive measures to address
the human rights situation.
Several states including Puebla, Quintana
Roo, Chiapas and the Federal District
adopted or sought to adopt laws on the
use of force by law enforcement officials
during demonstrations. These changes were
inconsistent with international human rights
standards and posed a threat to freedoms
of expression and association. In Puebla
state, which had recently approved such a
law, police officers were under investigation
at the end of the year for the death of a
13-year-old boy who died in the context
of a demonstration, possibly as a result of
excessive use of force. The changes to the
law were put under review after the incident.
In November the Senate appointed
the new president of the National Human
Rights Commission (CNDH) for the period
2014 to 2019. Human rights organizations
requested full consultation and transparency,
in compliance with international standards.
However, Senators only allowed for one
247meeting with civil society in which a limited
number of organizations had to present their
views briefly, without any further discussion.
Human rights defenders reiterated their
concerns over the ineffectiveness of the
CNDH in addressing the grave human rights
situation and called for the CNDH to fulfil its
key role in the protection of human rights and
the fight against impunity.
In response to massive demonstrations
to demand justice in the case of 43 forcibly
disappeared students, President Peña Nieto
announced on 27 November a series of
legislative and policy measures, including
a constitutional change that would give the
state control over local police. The measures
were to be implemented in stages, starting
in the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán
and Tamaulipas. The President also proposed
setting up a nationwide emergency number
911, as well as special economic zones in the
country’s impoverished south.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
Despite official claims that incidents of
organized crime-related violence fell, the
situation remained grave. The overall number
of homicides in the first nine months of the
year was 24,746, compared to 26,001 in
the first nine months of 2013. In September,
an official national survey estimated that
the number of abductions in 2013 had
reached 131,946, compared to 105,682 in
2012. Army and navy marines continued to
carry out law enforcement duties in many
states, often operating without effective
accountability, resulting in reports of arbitrary
detentions, torture and other ill-treatment and
extrajudicial executions.
In response to the high levels of violence
from organized crime, frequently in collusion
with local authorities, several armed
civilian self-defence groups emerged in
Michoacán state. In consequence, the federal
government deployed the armed forces
and Federal Police in large numbers along
with a new federal commissioner to oversee
security policy in the state. Negotiations with
248
several self-defence groups resulted in their
incorporation as rural police into official public
security forces.
Indigenous communities in Guerrero
state denounced the arrest and prosecution
of some of their members and leaders.
These communities had previously reached
agreements with the government regarding
their own law enforcement activities in their
areas, against a backdrop of long-lasting
neglect and rising crime levels. The cases
appeared to be politically motivated.
In July, soldiers killed 22 people allegedly
belonging to an armed gang in Tlatlaya,
Mexico state, in what military authorities
claimed was a firefight with gunmen. The
Federal Prosecutor failed to investigate
further, despite evidence that some of
the victims were killed at close range. In
September, media disclosed witness evidence
indicating that after a brief exchange of fire
many of those killed had been extrajudicially
executed after surrendering. On 8 November,
seven military personnel were charged and
continued to be under investigation for the
executions, but it remained unclear whether
officials who had sought to cover up the
incident would also be prosecuted in the
civilian justice system.
After some delays, in August the new
National Gendarmerie began operations
with 5,000 officers forming a division of
the Federal Police. The Gendarmerie was
a significantly smaller force than originally
proposed. Its role and operating practices
remained unclear. The government failed to
take on board recommendations to ensure
strong accountability mechanisms, operating
protocols and effective supervision to prevent
human rights violations. The force was
temporarily deployed in Mexico state and
Guerrero to assume policing functions.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Abductions and enforced disappearances
continued to occur widely. The whereabouts
of most victims remained undisclosed. During
the year, federal officials made a series
Amnesty International Report 2014/15of contradictory statements regarding the
number of persons reported disappeared or
missing and whose whereabouts remained
undisclosed. In August, the government
acknowledged some 22,611 missing persons,
9,790 of whom went missing during the
present administration and 12,821 during
the administration of President Felipe
Calderón (2006 to 2012). The government
failed to make public how it had arrived at
this figure. Impunity remained the norm for
cases of enforced disappearance. In April the
government stated that only seven convictions
had ever been achieved for the crime of
enforced disappearance at the federal level,
all between 2005 and 2010.
In September, municipal police in the
town of Iguala in collusion with organized
criminals were responsible for the enforced
disappearance of 43 students from a teacher
training college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero
state. Investigations uncovered several mass
graves and a dump site containing human
remains. In November, the Federal Attorney
General announced that the main line of
investigation, based on the testimonies of
three gang members apparently involved in
the case, indicated that the students were
killed, burned and dumped in a river. His
announcement failed to address the general
levels of impunity, corruption and unresolved
cases of disappearance in Mexico. More than
70 local public officials and gang members
were arrested and charged in relation to the
case. There was no information regarding
the possible responsibility, by omission or
commission, of public officials at the state
or federal level. On 7 December, the Federal
Attorney General announced that the remains
of one of the students had been identified
by independent forensic experts. By the end
of the year, the whereabouts of the other 42
remained undisclosed.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Arbitrary detention and torture and other
ill-treatment by members of the armed forces,
as well as federal, state and municipal police
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
forces remained widespread throughout the
country. These violations were frequently
used to extract “confessions” and other
information to pursue criminal investigations
or for other purposes such as extortion.
Despite scores of complaints at the federal
and state levels, there were few prosecutions
and almost no convictions of public officials
responsible.
As in previous years, the special medical
examination procedure of the Federal
Attorney General’s Office for cases of alleged
torture was not applied in most cases. In the
minority of cases where it was carried out,
it usually produced results unfavourable to
the complainant. Officials generally failed
to apply the procedure in compliance with
the principles of the Istanbul Protocol,
including promptness and providing victims
with full results. In two exceptional cases the
Federal Attorney General’s Office dropped
charges against the victims of torture after
finally accepting evidence that they had
been tortured in order to falsely implicate
themselves. The victims had spent between
three and five years in pre-trial detention.
Independent medical examinations, which
were conducted in line with the Istanbul
Protocol, were central to demonstrating that
they had been tortured.
In May the National Supreme Court
published its 2013 judgment on the case of
Israel Arzate who was arbitrarily arrested and
tortured by army officers in order to accuse
him of involvement in the Villas de Salvárcar
massacre in 2010. The judgment set out
important criteria for the inadmissibility of
evidence deriving from unlawful detention
and the obligation to investigate allegations of
torture. However, the judgment did not set a
binding precedent for other courts.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
Public security and criminal justice officials
frequently ignored human rights violations
and remained ineffective at investigating and
prosecuting common crime as well as human
rights violations, reinforcing impunity and
249distrust in the legal system. In March, a new
National Criminal Procedural Code for all 33
federal and state criminal justice jurisdictions
came into force as part of a gradual reform.
The government argued that the application
of the Code would improve the protection of
human rights by making evidence obtained
from human rights violations, such as
unlawful detentions and torture, inadmissible.
However, the Code had yet to be applied or
the criteria for excluding evidence worked out
in detail.
In January the Executive Commission for
the Attention of Victims was established under
the National Victims Law to provide victims
of crime, including human rights violations,
improved access to justice and reparations.
It replaced the Social Procurator for victims
of crime, but it remained unclear if it would
enjoy the resources and powers sufficient
to meet the needs of victims. The regulatory
code for the National Victims Law was not
approved, limiting implementation of the law.
In June, reforms to the Code of Military
Justice came into force. The reforms,
secured after years of campaigning by
victims and human rights organizations,
excluded from the system of military justice
crimes committed by members of the armed
forces against civilians. The reforms failed
to exclude from military jurisdiction human
rights violations committed against members
of the armed forces. Nevertheless they were a
major advance in ending impunity for abuses
committed by military personnel. At the end
of the year, four military personnel remained
in detention in the civilian justice system
accused of involvement in the 2002 rape
of two Indigenous women, Inés Fernández
Ortega and Valentina Rosendo Cantú.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
AND JOURNALISTS
Many human rights defenders and journalists
were threatened, attacked or killed in reprisal
for their legitimate work. No perpetrators
were known to have been identified or
brought to justice. This was largely due to
250
flawed investigations frequently as a result of
official disinterest, particularly by state-level
authorities. The pervasive impunity increased
the climate of insecurity within which
defenders and journalists operated.
The federal Mechanism for the Protection
of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists
announced in November that it had received
72 cases in the first nine months of the year.
In general, it continued to fail to provide
timely and effective protection. The agreed
protection measures were often reliant on
the support of local authorities, even in
those cases where local authorities were
thought to be involved in the attacks. Several
beneficiaries of protection measures were
temporarily forced to leave their communities
for security reasons. Other defenders
and journalists continued to wait for the
mechanism to review their cases.
Several human rights defenders and
community activists faced prosecution on
criminal charges that appeared politically
motivated in reprisal for their legitimate
activities, including participating in protests.
Many faced lengthy legal battles in unfair
judicial proceedings to prove their innocence.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Violence against women and girls remained
endemic throughout the country, including
rape, abductions and killings. Many
authorities continued to fail to implement
legal and administrative measures to
improve prevention, protection from and
investigation of gender-based violence.
The National System for the Prevention,
Sanction and Eradication of Violence against
Women refused to apply the “Gender Alert”
mechanism, which is designed to mobilize
authorities to combat widespread gender
violence and elicit an effective, official
response to cases of violence.
In January, the National Supreme Court
ordered the release of Adriana Manzanares
Cayetano, an Indigenous woman who spent
six years of a 22-year sentence in prison
after being convicted of killing her newborn
Amnesty International Report 2014/15baby. Evidence that the child was stillborn
was ignored, and violations of her right to an
effective defence and the presumption of
innocence resulted in an unsafe conviction.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Insecurity and social deprivation in their
home countries drove increasing numbers of
Central American migrants to cross Mexico to
reach the USA, particularly unaccompanied
children. Migrants continued to be killed,
abducted and subject to extortion by criminal
gangs, often operating in collusion with
public officials. Women and children were
particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and
people trafficking. There were continued
reports of ill-treatment by police and
migration officials carrying out detentions.
Irregular migrants continued to be held in
administrative detention pending deportation.
Migrants’ rights defenders providing safe
havens to migrants and denouncing abuses
suffered by migrants continued to face threats
and intimidation. Several received protection
measures, but in some cases these were not
applied effectively and failed to prevent new
threats being made. Those responsible for the
threats were not brought to justice.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
Indigenous communities continued to suffer
discrimination in the criminal justice system
as well as limited access to basic services,
such as water, housing and health care.
The failure to effectively consult Indigenous
communities in order to obtain free, prior
and informed consent regarding economic
development projects affecting their lands
and traditional way of living resulted in
protests and disputes. These in turn led to
threats and attacks on community leaders
and in some cases criminal prosecutions
of activists, apparently based on politically
motivated charges.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
In March, Mexico accepted 166 of 176
recommendations of the UN Human Rights
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Council Universal Periodic Review of Mexico.
In May, the UN Special Rapporteur on
torture visited Mexico and issued preliminary
conclusions that torture and other ill-
treatment remained widespread. In June,
the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial
executions published his report of his mission
to Mexico in early 2013, which highlighted
high levels of killings and impunity. In August
the Special Rapporteur on migrants’ rights of
the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights issued his report of his visit to Mexico.
The report detailed pervasive violence
against migrants, the denial of due process
and judicial protections, and other human
rights abuses.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
A telecommunications bill threatened to
establish potentially arbitrary executive
powers over the internet and insufficient
judicial control over the interception of
electronic communications.
MOLDOVA
Republic of Moldova
Head of state: Nicolae Timofti
Head of government: Iurie Leancă
Despite Moldova sentencing perpetrators
of torture to terms of imprisonment for
the first time, long-term systemic failings
meant that the widespread problem of
impunity persisted. The authorities failed
to amend discriminatory legislation, leaving
marginalized groups vulnerable.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The General Prosecutor’s Office said it
received significantly fewer complaints
of torture and other ill-treatment than for
2013. For the first time, in July, three police
officers were each sentenced to three years’
251imprisonment for the torture of two men in
2011, under Article 166 of the Criminal Code,
which came into effect in December 2012. In
September, a further two police officers were
sentenced to six years’ imprisonment and
one officer was given a five-year suspended
sentence for the torture of two brothers in
early 2012. These developments reflect
legislative changes that have facilitated
prosecution for torture and efforts to ensure
that law enforcement officers were better
informed of their human rights obligations
and the rights of detainees. However,
impunity for past police abuses remained a
significant problem.
2014 marked the fifth anniversary of the
April 2009 post-election demonstrations
and the authorities failed to deliver justice to
the vast majority of those who were tortured
or otherwise ill-treated by law enforcement
officers during those events. Of 102
official complaints received by the General
Prosecutor’s Office, criminal investigations
were initiated in 58 cases, of which only
31 cases reached the courts. Suspended
sentences were passed against 27 police
officers, and at the end of 2013 an officer
was acquitted of the murder of Valeriu Boboc,
who died as a result of injuries sustained
through torture.
The five-year statute of limitations
for alleged abuses committed by law
enforcement officers expired in April, leaving
a significant number of those who were
subjected to torture and other ill-treatment
during the events of April 2009 without
further recourse to domestic remedy. In May,
the Chisinau Court of Appeal overturned an
earlier decision by the Supreme Court of
Moldova and sentenced police officer Radu
Starinschi to two years’ imprisonment for
the torture of Sergiu Cretu but the sentence
could not be enforced as it fell outside the
period of the statute of limitations. In October,
the police officer was promoted. Not a
single police officer has been imprisoned in
connection with the April 2009 events. By the
end of the year the European Court of Human
252
Rights had ruled in seven cases and found
violations of Article 3 (prohibition of torture)
in each. In all seven cases, the Court found
that the investigations were heavily flawed
because of repeated refusals to start criminal
investigations, and the failure to take into
account vital evidence.
Torture and other ill-treatment of those held
in mental health institutions was increasingly
recognized as a concern. Following a pilot
project establishing an ombudsperson for
psychiatry which was initiated in 2011 in
a collaboration between the UN and the
Moldovan authorities, a high number of
complaints of torture were received and
progress was achieved in addressing them.
Plans were in place to formalize the position
and integrate it into Moldova’s official
health system.
CRUEL, INHUMAN OR
DEGRADING PUNISHMENT
The May 2012 law introducing compulsory
chemical castration as a punishment for
violent child abusers was abolished by
Parliament in December 2013.
DISCRIMINATION
The LGBTI community in Moldova celebrated
the first successful Pride march in May. While
the 2013 Pride march marked an historical
first, the 2014 event saw participants able
to walk the entire planned route through
the centre of the capital, Chisinau, for the
first time, and overall they were adequately
secured by the police against threats by
counter-demonstrators.
Despite this positive development, the Law
on Ensuring Equality, which came into effect
in January 2013, fell short of international
standards. The law does not explicitly list
sexual orientation and gender identity as one
of the prohibited grounds for discrimination,
apart from in relation to discrimination in
the workplace. Police failed to adequately
investigate a number of assaults on LGBTI
rights activists.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15MONGOLIA
Mongolia
Head of state: Tsakhia Elbegdorj
Head of government: Chimediin Saikhanbileg
Torture and other ill-treatment in police
custody remained widespread. Forced
evictions occurred in urban areas.
Discrimination based on gender, sexual
orientation and disability went largely
unchallenged. Asylum-seekers were
deported in violation of the non-refoulement
principle by being forcibly returned to a
country where they risked serious human
rights violations.
BACKGROUND
The International Convention against enforced
disappearance was ratified in October by
Mongolia. However, the Second Optional
Protocol to the ICCPR, aiming at the abolition
of the death penalty, which had been ratified
in 2012, had not led to changes in national
legislation.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The use of torture and other ill-treatment,
particularly to obtain “confessions”, remained
a serious human rights concern. Police
officers and prison guards suspected of
torture and other ill-treatment of people held
at police stations and detention centres were
not effectively investigated, leading to lack of
accountability.
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU)
in the State General Prosecutor’s Office
was disbanded in January. The SIU was
responsible for investigating complaints
against prosecutors, judges and police officers
who allegedly coerced statements during
interrogation. Mongolia therefore lacked
an independent mechanism to effectively
investigate allegations of torture and other
ill-treatment as the police themselves were in
charge of reviewing such claims.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In February, three former detainees who
had been held in the pre-trial detention
centre of Arkhangai province lodged a
complaint with the National Human Rights
Commission of Mongolia claiming that they
had been subjected to beatings and electric
shocks to extract “confessions” while held
there. One of them claimed that he had
been deprived of food for six days to coerce
him into pleading guilty. Because the SIU
had been disbanded, the police department
of Arkhangai province was in charge of
investigating their own colleagues. The
allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
were subsequently dismissed.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
Residents of ger (traditional wool felt
dwellings) districts in Ulaanbaatar suffered
from lack of access to adequate housing
and essential services including water and
sanitation. Promised adequate alternative
housing still had to be provided to some
of the residents of the 7th micro-district of
Ulaanbaatar who had been forcibly evicted
from their homes in 2007 without genuine
consultation or other appropriate legal or
procedural safeguards or protection.
DISCRIMINATION
Discrimination persisted on the basis
of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,
gender identity and disability. Gender
discrimination in particular affected women
from marginalized groups such as those
living in rural areas and ethnic minority
women. Hostility, discrimination and violence
especially against lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex individuals
continued. The legal definition of rape did not
include men and boys so male victims of rape
had particular difficulty in seeking adequate
treatment, justice, redress and compensation.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In May, two Chinese asylum-seekers from
the Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region were
deported back to the People's Republic of
253China. This occurred even though at least
one of them was in the process of having
his claim for refugee status determined by
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, violating
the non-refoulement principle by carrying
out deportations before the process of status
determination was completed, and sending
individuals to a country where they were at
risk of serious human rights violations.
MONTENEGRO
Montenegro
Head of state: Filip Vujanović
Head of government: Milo Djukanović
Decisions in war crimes cases continued
to be inconsistent with international law.
Independent journalists were subject to
threats and attacks. Impunity persisted
for law enforcement officers suspected of
torture and other ill-treatment.
CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW
In June, both the Committee against Torture
and the UN Working Group on Enforced
Disappearances found that the courts had
failed to fully apply domestic law and had
misinterpreted international humanitarian law
in decisions in cases prosecuted since 2008.
On 31 December 2013, a former Yugoslav
Army commander and seven reservists
were acquitted of the murder in April 1999
of 18 refugees from Kosovo in the village of
Kaluđerski Laz near Rozaje.
In February, the Appellate Court upheld
the conviction of four former Yugoslav Army
reservists for the torture and other ill-
treatment of around 250 Croatian Prisoners
of War at Morinj detention camp in 1991-
1992. They were sentenced to periods
of imprisonment that were less than the
statutory minimum and failed to reflect the
gravity of their crimes. In March, seven
254
former prisoners held at Morinj camp were
each awarded compensation of between
€20,000 and €30,000 for their ill-treatment.
A further 200 former prisoners were
claiming reparation.
In March, former police officials acquitted
of war crimes in 2013 opened a case
for compensation against Montenegro
for €1 million, on the grounds that they
were unlawfully detained and deprived of
their liberty.
In August, Montenegro signed a regional
declaration on missing persons, and
committed to establishing the fate and
whereabouts of 61 missing people.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Following the establishment in 2013 of a
Commission to monitor police investigations
into attacks and threats against journalists
and independent media, investigations were
reopened into the 2004 murder of Duško
Jovanović, editor of the Dan newspaper.
Suspects in the 2007 attack on journalist
Tufik Softić were arrested in July for
attempted murder. Investigations continued
into a series of attacks on the daily newspaper
Vijesti. Arrests were made in the case of Dan
journalist Lidija Nikčević, who was attacked
by masked men outside her office in Niksić
in January.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In May the European Committee for the
Prevention of Torture reported that in 2013
people detained or invited for “informative
talks” by the police ran an “appreciable
risk” of ill-treatment. They urged that law
enforcement officers be regularly informed
that ill-treatment is illegal.
In October, three police officers were
convicted and sentenced to the minimum
of three months’ imprisonment for assisting
in the ill-treatment of Aleksandar Pejanović
in the Betonjerka detention centre in 2008
by up to 10 masked members of the Special
Intervention Police Unit, whose identities were
Amnesty International Report 2014/15not disclosed to the prosecution by senior
police officials.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Discrimination against LGBTI people,
including threats and physical attacks,
continued. Perpetrators were rarely identified,
and where prosecutions took place, attacks
were generally classified as misdemeanors.
Legislative provisions introduced in 2013
allowing for the hate motive to be considered
in sentencing were not applied. The LGBTIQ
social centre in Podgorica was attacked 26
times during 2014, despite being provided
with police protection; the authorities failed
to conduct effective investigations and
bring perpetrators to justice. The Podgorica
Pride, held in November, was adequately
protected by police; 10 counter-protestors
were arrested.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians displaced from
Kosovo in 1999 remained without adequate
housing, including those living in containers
at the Konik collective centre. In November,
the foundation stone was laid for the
construction of adequate housing at Konik.
In May, Roma families who had been under
threat of eviction in Zverinjak for three years
were promised adequate housing in 2015.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
In July, eight men were acquitted of the
unlawful transportation to Italy of 70 Roma
refugees from Kosovo in 1999. Thirty-five of
the refugees drowned when the boat Miss
Pat – registered to carry six passengers –
capsized in Montenegrin waters.
Around a third of the 16,000 refugees in
Montenegro, including most of the 4,000
Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians displaced
from Kosovo, remain at risk of statelessness.
While a few had acquired the status of
“foreigner with permanent residence”, the
remainder had not yet applied or faced
barriers to obtaining personal documents,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
including passports, required to apply for the
status before the December 2014 deadline.
Montenegro remained a transit country
for migrants and asylum-seekers. Asylum
procedures were not effective; between
January and November only two people were
granted asylum.
MOROCCO/
WESTERN SAHARA
Kingdom of Morocco
Head of state: King Mohamed VI
Head of government: Abdelilah Benkirane
The authorities continued to restrict rights
to freedom of expression, association
and assembly. They curtailed dissent,
prosecuting journalists and imprisoning
activists, restricted human rights groups
and other associations, and forcibly
dispersed peaceful and other protests.
Torture and other ill-treatment in detention
persisted due to inadequate safeguards
and accountability, and courts’ acceptance
of torture-tainted confessions. A new law
closed a loophole that had enabled rapists
to evade justice, but women remained
inadequately protected against sexual
violence. Authorities collaborated in
the unlawful expulsion of migrants and
asylum-seekers to Morocco from Spain.
The death penalty remained in force but
the government maintained a longstanding
moratorium on executions.
BACKGROUND
Following the introduction of a new
Constitution in 2011, the government began
implementing legal and judicial reforms.
Legislators approved a law to end trials of
civilians before military courts and amended
the Penal Code to prevent rapists evading
255punishment by marrying the victim. Draft
Codes of Criminal and Civil Procedure had yet
to be debated at the end of 2014.
Political dissent receded compared to
previous years but social unrest continued,
marked by protests on employment,
housing, and a fairer distribution of the
wealth generated from the country’s
natural resources.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Authorities prosecuted journalists, activists,
artists and others who criticized, or were
deemed to have insulted, the King or state
institutions, or to have advocated “terrorism”,
according to the broad meaning of this term
under Morocco’s anti-terrorism legislation.
Journalist Ali Anouzla remained on trial
charged with advocating and assisting
terrorism for publishing an article on the
Lakome online news website about a video
released by the armed group al-Qa’ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Although he did
not republish the video, entitled Morocco:
Kingdom of Corruption and Despotism,
and branded it “propaganda”, if convicted
Ali Anouzla could face up to 20 years’
imprisonment. 1
Authorities brought defamation and public
insult charges against journalist Hamid El
Mahdaoui, after the national director of police
complained about articles he had published
on the Badil news website about the death
of Karim Lachqar in Al Hoceima following his
arrest and detention by police. The police
called for the journalist to be banned from
his profession for 10 years, and that he pay
them heavy damages. His trial was continuing
at the end of the year. Rabie Lablak, who
witnessed Karim Lachqar’s arrest, was
prosecuted for “false reporting” about the
circumstances of the arrest.
In June and July, two members of the
Moroccan Association for Human Rights
(AMDH), Oussama Housne and Wafae
Charaf, were convicted on charges of “falsely
reporting” that unidentified individuals had
previously abducted and tortured them. They
256
were sentenced to prison terms of three and
two years respectively and ordered to pay
compensation for “slander” of the police
although neither of them had accused the
police. 2 Their prosecution and imprisonment
could deter victims of police abuses from
coming forward.
In October, a court sentenced 17-year-
old rapper Othman Atiq, who uses the
stage name “Mr Crazy”, to three months in
prison for “insulting” Morocco’s police force,
“harming public morality” and “incitement
to drugs consumption” in his songs and
music videos.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
Authorities blocked efforts by several human
rights groups to obtain official registration
that would allow them to operate legally. They
included AMDH branches and Freedom Now,
a press freedom organization founded by Ali
Anouzla and other independent journalists,
human rights defenders and intellectuals.
During the second half of 2014, authorities
banned public events by several human
rights groups across the country. Restrictions
continued unabated until the end of the year
despite a landmark administrative court ruling
deeming the ban of an AMDH public event in
Rabat in September to be unlawful. 3
In September, authorities also prevented
Amnesty International from holding its annual
youth camp. 4
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Police and other security forces dispersed
peaceful and other protests by unemployed
graduates, workers, students, social justice
activists, and supporters of the 20 February
Movement, which advocates political reform.
Unnecessary or excessive force was often
used. Other protests were banned. Some
protesters were arrested and detained for
months, then sentenced to prison terms
after trials that failed to satisfy international
standards of fair trial. Courts often relied
on shaky evidence to convict protesters
Amnesty International Report 2014/15on charges of assaulting security forces or
damaging property.
In December, authorities imposed a fine of
1 million dirhams (approximately €90,000)
on 52 members of the Al-Adl Wal Ihsane
(Justice and Spirituality) organization in the
area of Tinghir and Ouarzazate for “holding
unauthorized meetings” in private homes
in 2008.
In April, police arrested nine men after they
participated in a peaceful demonstration by
graduates seeking public sector employment
in Rabat. Youssef Mahfoud, Ahmed El Nioua,
Moufid El Khamis, Rachid Benhamou,
Soulimane Benirou, Abdelhak El Har, Aziz
El Zitouni, Mohamed El Allali and Mustapha
Abouzir subsequently received prison
sentences of 28 months, 12 months of which
were suspended, after being convicted of
charges including “obstructing trains” and
“rebellion”.
Eleven members of the 20 February
Movement were also arrested in April when
they attended a peaceful and officially
authorized trade union demonstration in
Casablanca. Two of them received suspended
sentences of two months’ imprisonment
and were released, but the nine others were
held in pre-trial detention until June, when
they were convicted on charges of assaulting
police officers. They were sentenced to
prison terms of six months or a year, as well
as fined and ordered to pay compensation to
the police. Their sentences were suspended
on appeal.
REPRESSION OF DISSENT
– SAHRAWI ACTIVISTS
Moroccan authorities continued to clamp
down on all advocacy of Sahrawi self-
determination in Western Sahara, annexed by
Morocco in 1975. Sahrawi political activists,
protesters, human rights defenders and
media workers faced an array of restrictions
affecting their rights to freedom of expression,
association and assembly, and were liable
to arrest, torture and other ill-treatment
and prosecution. The authorities did not
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
permit protests and forcibly dispersed
gatherings when they did occur, often using
excessive force.
Abdelmoutaleb Sarir alleged that police
officers subjected him to torture, including
rape with a bottle, after his arrest in February
in connection with a protest in Laayoune,
and forced him to sign an interrogation report
without permitting him to read it. Judicial
authorities are not known to have investigated
his allegations or ordered a medical
examination to identify torture-related injuries.
On 10 September, a court sentenced him to
10 months in prison on charges that included
“forming a criminal gang” and “insulting and
assaulting security officers”, on the basis of
the confession contained in the interrogation
report that he said he had been forced to
sign. 5
Moroccan officials in Western Sahara
frustrated attempts by human rights groups
such as the Sahrawi Association of Victims of
Grave Human Rights Violations Committed by
the Moroccan State (ASVDH) to obtain official
registration, which they require to operate
legally, have official premises, hold public
events, and apply for funding.
At least 39 foreign journalists and activists
reported that Moroccan authorities barred
them from entry or expelled them from
Western Sahara in 2014.
In April, the UN Security Council again
extended the mandate of the UN Mission
for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) for a year, but without adding a
human rights monitoring component.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment, often in the
immediate aftermath of arrest, continued
to be reported. In a few cases, medical
examinations were ordered but generally the
authorities failed to conduct investigations.
Courts continued to accept as evidence of
guilt confessions that defendants alleged
had been obtained through torture or other
ill-treatment.
257The Minister of Justice and Liberties issued
letters to prosecutors and judges in May,
calling for them to order forensic medical
examinations and investigations when faced
with allegations of torture or other ill-treatment
in detention.
In May, authorities re-opened an
investigation into the torture of prisoner
Ali Aarrass following a decision by the UN
Committee against Torture. Ali Aarrass,
detained in Morocco since his forcible return
from Spain in 2010, reported being tortured
and otherwise ill-treated during his detention
in Morocco in 2010 and subsequently.
The investigation was ongoing at the end of
the year.
In August, a court in Agadir overturned
the conviction of a defendant on the ground
that his confession was coerced after a
forensic medical examination had confirmed
his torture. A police officer remained under
investigation for alleged torture or other ill-
treatment at the end of the year.
Prison inmates, including untried
detainees, launched hunger strikes to protest
against harsh conditions, including poor
hygiene and sanitation, inadequate nutrition
and health care, severe overcrowding, and
limited visiting rights and access to education.
UNFAIR TRIALS
Courts frequently ignored complaints by
defence lawyers about violations of criminal
procedure and relied on confessions
allegedly obtained through torture or other
ill-treatment while defendants were held in
pre-trial detention. In some cases, courts
refused to allow defence lawyers to cross-
examine prosecution witnesses or to call
defence witnesses.
Authorities prosecuted protesters and
activists on charges such as rebellion, armed
gathering, assault, theft and property damage,
or on drugs charges.
Mbarek Daoudi, a former Moroccan
army soldier and advocate of Sahrawi self-
determination, remained in detention awaiting
trial before the Permanent Military Court in
258
Rabat. The victim of an apparently politically
motivated prosecution, he faced charges of
possessing ammunition without a licence
and attempted manufacturing of weapons,
based on his possession of an antique rifle
that police found when they arrested him in
September 2013. His trial, due to open in
January 2014, was postponed indefinitely at
the prosecution’s request.
In March, gendarmes arrested Omar
Moujane, Ibrahim Hamdaoui and
Abdessamad Madri, activists who were
participating in a peaceful protest against the
use of natural resources at a silver mine near
Imider, in the southern Atlas mountains. The
three were ill-treated during interrogation,
and then tried and convicted on charges
that included obstructing traffic and the right
to work, unauthorized protest and criminal
damage and rebellion. They were sentenced
after an unfair trial to three-year prison terms,
fined, and ordered to pay compensation to
the mining company. The court relied heavily
on interrogation reports that the defendants
said they were misled into signing and not
allowed to read. At the end of the year, the
cases were awaiting review by the Court
of Cassation.
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY
Despite progress on judicial reforms, the
authorities made no progress on other
key recommendations of the Equity and
Reconciliation Commission concerning
security sector reform and a national
strategy to combat impunity. Victims of the
serious human rights violations perpetrated
between 1956 and 1999 continued to be
denied justice, and several cases of enforced
disappearance remained unresolved.
WOMEN’S AND GIRLS' RIGHTS
In January, parliament agreed an amendment
to Article 475 of the Penal Code that removed
a provision that had formerly allowed
men who raped girls under 18 to escape
justice by marrying the victims. However,
a draft law on violence against women and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15children, intended to remedy the lack of a
comprehensive legal and policy framework
to address such abuses, remained under
consideration by the expert committee to
which it was referred in December 2013.
Women were inadequately protected
against sexual violence, and consensual sex
outside marriage remained a crime.
RIGHT TO PRIVACY
In May, September and December, courts in
Fqih Ben Salah, Marrakech and Al Hoceima
convicted eight men on charges that included
engaging in homosexual acts and imposed
prison terms of up to three years. Consensual
same-sex acts remained a crime.
POLISARIO CAMPS
The Tindouf camps in Algeria’s Mhiriz
region that accommodate Sahrawis who fled
Western Sahara at the time of its annexation
by Morocco continued to lack regular
independent human rights monitoring. The
Polisario Front took no measures to end
impunity for those accused of committing
human rights abuses in the camps during the
1970s and 1980s.

2. Morocco: Activists jailed for reporting torture must be released
REFUGEES, ASYLUM-
SEEKERS AND MIGRANTS
Authorities continued to collaborate with
Spanish officials in unlawfully expelling
migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa,
who entered Spain irregularly by crossing
the border fence between Morocco and
the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta.
Moroccan authorities co-operated in the
readmission to Morocco of some of these
migrants, including possible asylum-
seekers, amid reports that both Spanish and
Moroccan border police used unnecessary
and excessive force. The authorities failed
to investigate these deaths and injuries, and
other incidents of racial violence against sub-
Saharan migrants in August and September
in Tangiers and Nador.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts imposed at least nine death sentences;
there were no executions. The government
maintained a de facto moratorium on
executions in place since 1993. No death row
prisoners had their sentences commuted to
prison terms.
In December, Morocco abstained on a
UN General Assembly resolution calling for a
worldwide moratorium on executions.

MOZAMBIQUE
Republic of Mozambique
Head of state and government: Filipe Jacinto Nyussi
(replaced Armando Guebuza in October)
Police used unlawful force and firearms
resulting in some deaths. Criticism of
President Guebuza on Facebook led to
criminal charges against one person. Draft
laws impacting on the rights of women and
girls were approved by Parliament, but still
had to be passed into law.
259BACKGROUND
On 23 May, Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the
Mozambique National Resistance, declared
that he would stand for Presidential elections.
In September he returned to the capital,
Maputo, and publicly signed a peace deal
with President Armando Guebuza. Afonso
Dhlakama had been in hiding since October
2013 when Mozambique armed forces
invaded his base in Satunjira, Sofala province.
The peace deal signed in September ended
the two year-long clashes between Renamo
fighters and the ForçasArmadas de Defesa de
Moçambique (FADM), as well as the attacks
by Renamo fighters on buses and cars on the
main highway. The clashes resulted in the
deaths of scores of people, including civilians.
On 15 October Mozambique held its fifth
Presidential elections since independence
in 1975. The ruling party, Front for the
Liberation of Mozambique, maintained power
and the former Minister of Defence, Filipe
Jacinto Nyussi, became Mozambique’s third
democratically elected President.
Mozambique’s human rights record was
assessed at the 55th Ordinary Session of the
African Commission on Human and Peoples’
Rights hosted by Angola in Luanda from 28
April to 12 May. 1
UNLAWFUL KILLINGS
Police reportedly made unlawful use of
firearms in Maputo, Gaza and Nampula
provinces resulting in at least four deaths. No
investigations appear to have been carried out
into these cases to determine the lawfulness
of the use of firearms by the police.
In January, police shot and killed 26-year-
old Ribeiro João Nhassengo and another
person. A police spokesperson claimed
that police responded to an anonymous
call regarding cars outside a shop in the
Triunfo neighbourhood of Maputo in the
early hours around 29 January and found
men in two cars with an alleged kidnapping
victim. The police spokesperson stated that
the suspects let the victim go, but a shoot-
out ensued. Ribeiro João Nhassengo and
260
another unnamed individual were reportedly
shot in the crossfire. However, footage of the
incident showed that Ribeiro João Nhassengo
had been shot and killed while inside a car
with closed windows. No investigation has
been carried out into the circumstances
surrounding the deaths to determine the
lawfulness of the use of firearms by police.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
There were reports of police using excessive
force against alleged criminal suspects, those
they suspected of being Renamo fighters, as
well as unarmed civilians.
On 21 June, an armed police officer in
the central neighbourhood of Maputo shot
at a vehicle after an altercation regarding an
illegal traffic manoeuvre. The officer from
the Mozambique Republic Police reportedly
stopped the driver around 8pm and
questioned him about the illegal manoeuvre.
When the driver requested a traffic officer be
called to provide him with a traffic fine, the
police officer reportedly threatened to kill him.
An altercation ensued and the police officer
reportedly shot at the car three times.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In August, parliament provisionally approved
the Access to Information Bill, which had
been in discussion since 2005. It still required
further approval by parliament and signing
into law by the President at the end of the
year. Despite this step forward, the right to
freedom of expression was suppressed.
In May, economist Carlos Nuno Castelo-
Branco was called before the Public
Prosecutor’s office in Maputo to answer
questions related to charges against him for
defamation against the Head of State, which
constitutes a crime against the security of the
state. The charges emanated from an open
letter Carlos Nuno Castelo-Branco had posted
on his Facebook page in November 2013,
questioning the governance of the country
by President Guebuza. The open letter was
subsequently published by some newspapers
Amnesty International Report 2014/15in the country. No further proceedings were
reported by the end of the year.
WOMEN’S AND GIRLS’ RIGHTS
In July, parliament approved the draft
Criminal Code without a controversial article
that would have enabled rapists to escape
prosecution by marrying their victim. Human
rights activists had campaigned against this
article. 2
The draft approved by Parliament further
did not require an official complaint from
relevant individuals in the case of sexual
offences against those under 16 years of age
before starting a criminal proceeding. It still
required an official complaint to be made
by all other victims of sexual offences before
a criminal proceeding could be instituted.
However, an article remained on the rape of
minors, which referred to minors as those
under 12 years of age. The draft law was
waiting to be signed by the President before
becoming law at the end of the year.

deteriorated, with ongoing discrimination
in law and practice exacerbated by a
dire humanitarian situation. Anti-Muslim
violence persisted, with the authorities
failing to hold suspected perpetrators to
account. Reports of abuses of international
human rights and humanitarian law in areas
of armed conflict persisted. Freedoms of
expression and peaceful assembly remained
severely restricted, with scores of human
rights defenders, journalists and political
activists arrested and imprisoned. Impunity
persisted for past crimes.
BACKGROUND
Myanmar assumed the chair of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in January. In March, the
government announced parliamentary
by-elections for the end of the year, later
cancelled, and general elections in 2015.
Despite a national campaign to amend the
2008 Constitution, led by the opposition
National League for Democracy (NLD) and
its leader Aung San Suu Kyi, by the end of
the year she was still constitutionally barred
from running for the presidency, and the
military still held a veto power on any future
constitutional changes.

MYANMAR
Republic of the Union of Myanmar
Head of state and government: Thein Sein
Despite ongoing political, legal and
economic reforms, progress on human
rights stalled, with some backward steps
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
DISCRIMINATION
The situation of the Rohingya worsened
during the year. Individuals suffered
persistent discrimination in law and policy,
exacerbated by a deepening humanitarian
crisis, ongoing eruptions of religious and
anti-Muslim violence, and government
failures to investigate attacks on Rohingya
and other Muslims. The authorities also failed
to address incitement to violence based on
national, racial and religious hatred.
In January, reports emerged of clashes
between security forces, Buddhist Rakhine
and Muslim Rohingya in Du Chee Yar Tan
village, Rakhine state. Two investigations
– one by the government and one by
the Myanmar National Human Rights
261Commission (MNHRC) – claimed to have
found no evidence to substantiate allegations
of any violence. In July, two people were killed
and dozens injured when religious violence
broke out in Mandalay, the second largest
city. Again, no independent investigation was
known to have been carried out.
An estimated 139,000 people – mostly
Rohingya – remained displaced in Rakhine
state for a third year after violent clashes
erupted between Rakhine Buddhists,
Rohingya and other Muslims in 2012. The
dire humanitarian situation worsened after the
expulsion of some humanitarian organizations
and the withdrawal of others in February and
March, following attacks against them by
Rakhine people. The displaced population
were left without access to emergency and
life-sustaining assistance. By the end of
the year, although most organizations had
returned, assistance was still not back to
levels prior to the withdrawals.
Violence between religious communities
and restricted humanitarian access continued
within a broader context of discriminatory
laws and policies against the Rohingya,
who remained deprived of nationality under
the 1982 Citizenship Act. As a result they
continued to face restrictions on their
freedom of movement, with repercussions
for their access to livelihoods. On 30 March,
one day before the start of the first national
census in Myanmar since 1983, the Ministry
of Information announced that Rohingya
would have to register as “Bengalis” – a term
used to deny recognition to the Rohingya
and to imply that they are all migrants from
Bangladesh. In October, the government
announced a new Rakhine State Action Plan
which if implemented would further entrench
discrimination and segregation of Rohingya.
The announcement of the plan appeared
to trigger a new wave of people fleeing the
country in boats, adding to the more than
87,000 who, according to UNHCR, the UN
refugee agency, had already fled by sea since
the violence started in 2012.
262
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS
The government and ethnic armed groups
failed to agree to a nationwide ceasefire,
despite the signing in 2012 of preliminary
ceasefire agreements. The armed conflict in
Kachin and Northern Shan states continued
into its fourth year, with violations of
international humanitarian and human rights
law reported on both sides, including unlawful
killings and torture and other ill-treatment,
including rape and other crimes of sexual
violence. 1 The conflict started in June 2011
after the Myanmar Army broke its ceasefire
with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA),
leading to widespread and continuous
displacement of civilian populations.
Around 98,000 people remained displaced
at the end of the year. The government
continued to deny full and sustained access
for humanitarian workers to displaced
communities in Kachin state, particularly
those displaced in KIA-controlled areas.
In September, fighting erupted in Karen
and Mon states between the Myanmar
Army and armed opposition groups, causing
civilians to flee.
The Myanmar Army was reported to have
discharged 376 children and young adults
from its forces as part of ongoing efforts to
end the use of child soldiers and underage
military recruitment.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION
AND PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY
Freedoms of expression and peaceful
assembly remained severely restricted, with
scores of human rights defenders, journalists,
political activists and farmers arrested or
imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of
their rights.
Ko Htin Kyaw, leader of the Movement
for Democracy Current Force (MDCF),
a community-based organization, was
convicted on 11 different counts of violating
Section 505(b) of the Penal Code and three
separate counts under Article 18 of the
Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession
Law. He was sentenced to a total of 13
Amnesty International Report 2014/15years and four months’ imprisonment for
delivering speeches, distributing leaflets and
holding protests calling on the government
to resign and against land evictions. Three
other members of MDCF were also jailed for
peaceful political activities. 2
In June the President signed into law
amendments to the Peaceful Assembly and
Peaceful Procession Law, commonly used
by authorities to imprison peaceful protesters
since its adoption in 2011. However,
despite the revisions the law retained severe
restrictions on the right to freedom of peaceful
assembly. 3
Media reforms were undermined by the
arrest and imprisonment of journalists and
other media workers. In July, five media
workers for the Unity newspaper were
sentenced to 10 years in prison under the
Official Secrets Act for the publication of
an article about an alleged secret chemical
weapons factory. Their sentence was reduced
on appeal to seven years’ imprisonment in
October. 4 At least 10 media workers remained
in prison by the end of the year.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
The President failed to keep his promise to
release all prisoners of conscience by the end
of 2013, despite a far-reaching Presidential
Pardon announced on 30 December 2013.
Muslim leader Dr Tun Aung was among those
not released under the pardon. One prisoner
amnesty was announced in 2014, just weeks
ahead of major international meetings in the
country. Only one prisoner of conscience was
believed to be among those released.
The Committee for Scrutinizing the
Remaining Prisoners of Conscience,
established by the government in February
2013, did not function effectively and it was
unclear whether it would continue to operate
beyond 2014.
LAND DISPUTES
Protests against land confiscations and forced
evictions were widespread. A parliamentary
committee established to investigate land
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
disputes in 2012 had reportedly received
over 6,000 reports of land confiscations.
However, failures to resolve or respond to
land disputes led farmers and other affected
people increasingly to resort to so-called
“plough protests”, with farmers ploughing
the disputed land. Some protests were met
with unnecessary or excessive use of force
by security forces. Many farmers and human
rights defenders supporting them were
arrested and charged, often under provisions
in the Penal Code relating to trespass and
criminal damage.
In March, members of the Michaungkan
community resumed a sit-in protest close
to Yangon’s City Hall after the authorities
failed to resolve their land dispute case. They
were calling for the return of land which they
alleged was confiscated by the military in
the 1990s and for compensation for their
losses. Community leader U Sein Than was
subsequently arrested for protesting without
permission and obstruction, and sentenced to
two years’ imprisonment. 5
In December, police opened fire on
protesters demonstrating against their lands
being taken over for the Letpadaung copper
mine in Sagaing region. One person was
killed and several injured, sparking a series
of peaceful protests in major cities across
the country. At least seven peaceful activists
were subsequently charged with protesting
without permission and offences under the
Penal Code. Environmental and human rights
concerns related to the mining project had
not been addressed by the end of the year.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture was still not criminalized as a distinct
offence and Myanmar failed to ratify the
UN Convention against Torture as promised
by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in
January. Officers from the police and military
faced persistent allegations of torture and
other ill-treatment, both conflict-related
and of criminal suspects. Investigations
into complaints were rare and suspected
perpetrators were seldom held to account.
263Victims and their families did not have access
to effective remedy. 6
In October it was reported that freelance
journalist Aung Kyaw Naing, also known as
Par Gyi, was killed while in the custody of the
Myanmar Army. He had been detained on
30 September in Mon state while reporting
on the resumption of fighting between the
Myanmar Army and armed groups in the
area. The Myanmar Army claimed that he
was a “communications captain” for an
armed opposition group, and that he was shot
while attempting to escape military custody.
After national and international pressure,
in November the police and the MNHRC
opened an investigation. At the end of the
year no one was known to have been held to
account for his death. 7
In August, Myanmar Army soldiers
detained and beat seven farmers in Kone Pyin
village, Chin State, whom they accused of
having contact with the Chin National Army,
an armed opposition group. The seven were
ill-treated – some of them tortured – over a
period of between four and nine days. By
the end of the year there was no information
about an independent investigation into the
case, or of suspected direct perpetrators or
their superiors being brought to justice. 8
IMPUNITY
Immunity from prosecution for past violations
by the security forces and other government
officials remained codified in Article 445 of
the 2008 Constitution. Victims of past human
rights violations and their families continued
to be denied truth, justice, compensation and
any other form of reparation.
More than three years after Sumlut Roi
Ja was detained by the military, her fate
and whereabouts remained unknown. She
disappeared in October 2011 in Kachin
state after being detained by Myanmar Army
soldiers along with her husband and father-
in-law. Her husband, who managed to escape
with her father-in-law, lodged a case with the
Supreme Court in January 2012. The case
was dismissed in March 2012, with the Court
citing lack of evidence.
The MNHRC remained largely ineffective
in responding to complaints of human rights
violations. In March, the law establishing
the MNHRC was adopted by the national
Parliament and a new Commission was
formed in September. Most members were
government-affiliated and the selection and
appointment process lacked transparency,
casting further doubts on the independence
and effectiveness of the Commission.
DEATH PENALTY
On 2 January the President commuted all
death sentences to terms of imprisonment.
However, provisions allowing for the
imposition of the death penalty remained part
of the legal framework, and at least one new
death sentence was imposed during the year.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
The new UN Special Rapporteur on the
situation of human rights in Myanmar visited
the country in July; she presented her report
to the General Assembly in October, warning
against potential backtracking on human
rights. The authorities failed to sign an
agreement for the establishment of an Office
of the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights and to ratify core international human
rights treaties. In November, Myanmar was
under increased scrutiny when world leaders
gathered in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, for the
ASEAN and East Asia Summits. US President
Barack Obama visited the country for the
second time.

NAMIBIA
Republic of Namibia
Head of state: Hifikipunye Pohamba
Head of government: Hage Geingob
The long-running treason trial of Caprivi
detainees continued, with most of the men
having spent more than 14 years in custody.
The policy of not offering protection
to refugees persecuted for their sexual
orientation was challenged by a gay asylum-
seeker from Uganda. Gender-based violence
remained a concern.
BACKGROUND
General elections were held on 28 November.
The South West Africa People’s Organization
(SWAPO) secured 87% of the presidential
vote, and 80% of the National Assembly vote.
CAPRIVI DETAINEES’ TRIAL
Sixty-five men in the Caprivi treason case
remained in detention facing 278 charges,
including counts of high treason, sedition,
murder and attempted murder. Forty-three
Caprivi detainees had been acquitted on
11 February 2013. Some of the released
prisoners of conscience sued the government
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
for damages. Nine detainees who were tried
separately and had been found guilty by the
High Court had their convictions set aside
and their cases referred back to the High
Court for retrial. Eight of the accused claimed
that they had been abducted by state agents
in Botswana and unlawfully transferred to
Namibia on various dates between September
2002 and December 2013.
Many of the Caprivi detainees were
possible prisoners of conscience because
they were arrested solely on the basis of their
actual or perceived political views, ethnicity
or membership of certain organizations. The
group was being tried under what is known as
the “common purpose” doctrine, which shifts
the burden of proof from the prosecution to
the defendants and undermines the right to
presumption of innocence. Another accused
man was on trial separately; his trial had not
concluded by the end of the year.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In April, Namibia’s Commissioner for
Refugees, Nkrumah Mushelenga, reportedly
said in the press that “[Namibia’s] domestic
refugee law does not have a provision
granting refugee status for being gay”.
However, as a signatory to the UN Refugee
Convention and its 1967 Protocol, Namibia is
expressly forbidden from returning refugees
who face persecution in their country of origin
on the basis of belonging to a social group
with a well-founded fear of persecution.
In August, a Ugandan asylum-seeker was
granted an urgent halt to his deportation
from Namibia. The man had sought asylum
because of his fear of persecution in Uganda
on the basis of his sexual orientation. The
man, who identifies himself as being gay,
was detained in Walvis Bay and was facing
deportation back to Uganda where legislation
had recently been adopted criminalizing
homosexuality (although the law was later
annulled by Uganda’s Constitutional Court).
265EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
On 27 August an unarmed protester, Frieda
Ndatipo, was shot dead by police during a
demonstration outside the headquarters of
the ruling SWAPO party. She was taking part
in a protest by Children of the Liberation
Struggle, a pressure group formed to
demand benefits and employment from
the government for the children of SWAPO
members who died in exile prior to the
country’s independence.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Gender-based violence remained a serious
concern. The government declared 6 March
as the national day of prayer for action against
gender-based violence. A report by UNAIDS
and Namibian NGO Victim 2 Survivors
recommended, among other things, that
gender-based violence be declared a national
emergency, that a national action plan on
gender-based violence be implemented, and
that support be mobilized from all sectors of
society, including the government, legislature,
judiciary, civil society, traditional authorities,
faith organizations, media outlets, the private
sector and community members.
NAURU
Republic of Nauru

population, including the rights to adequate
housing, access to clean drinking water,
education, health care and employment. The
presence of refugees placed a significant
strain on already limited resources.
As at 30 June 2014, there were 1,169
asylum-seekers in the Australian-run
immigration detention centre on Nauru,
including 193 children and 289 women.
A total of 168 people who had received
positive refugee assessments were
accommodated separately.
At least 61 asylum-seekers were awaiting
trial on charges relating to a disturbance at
the detention centre in July 2013. There
were concerns over fair trial rights for these
asylum-seekers, including around inadequate
legal representation and delays in court
proceedings.
Asylum-seeking children were particularly
vulnerable to mental health issues due to
arbitrary and prolonged detention, lack
of meaningful activities and inadequate
provision for education. Allegations of
physical and sexual abuse were made by
asylum-seekers, but it was not clear what
measures, if any, were taken by Australian or
Nauruan authorities to investigate. Intolerable
conditions in detention created a risk of
refoulement, in cases where detainees felt
they had no option but to return to a place
where their lives or human rights were at risk.
In April 2014, the UN Working Group on
Arbitrary Detention and Amnesty International
were both refused access to the immigration
detention centre. 1
Asylum-seekers were arbitrarily detained
in harsh conditions in accordance with an
agreement with the Australian government.
The arbitrary removal of judges and
suspension of parliamentarians raised
concerns about the rule of law and freedom
of expression. JUSTICE SYSTEM

NEPAL
Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal
Head of state: Ram Baran Yadav
Head of government: Sushil Koirala
Impunity was further entrenched as the
Constituent Assembly passed an act to
establish a transitional justice mechanism
with the power to recommend amnesties for
crimes under international law committed
during the country’s civil war (1996-
2006), in defiance of a Supreme Court
ruling. National institutions protecting
human rights were weakened by a lack of
political will, and impunity persisted for
past and current human rights violations.
Discrimination, including on the basis
of gender, caste, class, ethnic origin and
religion, remained rife. Arbitrary detention,
torture and extrajudicial executions were
reported throughout the year.
BACKGROUND
The second Constituent Assembly was formed
on 21 January; the first was dissolved in May
2012 after failing to draft a new Constitution.
Sushil Koirala of the Nepali Congress Party
was appointed as Prime Minister on 11
February. The new Constituent Assembly
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
pledged to promulgate a new Constitution
by 22 January 2015, although it remained
unclear whether this could be achieved
as political parties debated the model of
federalism and greater autonomy for ethnic
minorities and Indigenous Peoples. In July,
the government adopted its fourth Five Year
Human Rights National Action Plan. In
September, a year after the terms of previous
Commissioners of the National Human
Rights Commission (NHRC) had expired,
the government elected former Chief Justice
Anup Raj Sharma as Chair and nominated
new commissioners in October.
TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
On 25 April, the parliament passed the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Act,
establishing two commissions, a TRC and a
Commission on Enforced Disappearances,
with the power to recommend amnesties,
including for serious human rights violations.
This was despite a Supreme Court ruling in
January that a similar 2013 TRC ordinance
with the power to recommend amnesties
contravened international human rights
law and the spirit of the 2007 Interim
Constitution. Victims’ families filed a petition
with the Supreme Court for the provisions on
amnesties to be amended.
IMPUNITY
Accountability for human rights abuses and
victims’ rights to justice, truth and reparation
continued to be seriously undermined by
police failures to register First Information
Reports (FIRs), conduct investigations and
follow court orders, including in cases of
alleged extrajudicial executions, human
trafficking, gender-based violence, and torture
and other ill-treatment.
In July, forensic evidence collected by the
NHRC on the 2003 enforced disappearance
and extrajudicial execution of five students in
Dhanusha district confirmed the identities of
the victims, who had been blindfolded and
shot at close range with ammunition used
only by the Nepalese Army at the time. The
267police had delayed their investigation for the
four previous years citing a lack of evidence,
and had not acted on the new findings by the
end of the year.
ABUSES IN THE TERAI REGION
A longstanding culture of impunity meant
that, although the activities of armed groups
operating in the Terai (Madhes) region
declined, violations by police continued to be
reported, including arbitrary detention, torture
and extrajudicial executions. Police failed to
file FIRs, conduct investigations or prosecute
those responsible for these crimes.
C.K. Raut, a vocal proponent of
independence for the Terai, was arrested
and charged with sedition on 8 October for
his alleged involvement in “anti-national
activities”; he had called for an “independent
Madhes” at a public rally in Morang. He was
later arrested several times while on bail for
attempting to hold public rallies. Several of his
supporters were also arrested and injured in
police crackdowns at public meetings.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
At least half a million Nepalese migrated
abroad through official channels for work,
largely in low-skilled sectors such as
construction, manufacturing and domestic
work. Many continued to be trafficked for
exploitation and forced labour by recruitment
agencies and brokers. Recruiters deceived
migrant workers about their pay and working
conditions, and charged fees in excess of
government-imposed limits, forcing many
to take up loans at exorbitant rates. Women
aged under 30 were still banned from
migrating for work to Gulf states. While this
was intended to protect women, it meant that
many were forced to use informal channels,
thus increasing their risk of exploitation
and abuse. Concerns on health and safety
were highlighted as deaths of workers
abroad reached 880 between July 2013 and
July 2014.
The government made some efforts to
address trafficking and corruption in the
268
recruitment process. However, in practice,
unscrupulous recruitment agencies continued
to operate with impunity while trafficked
victims and their families faced enormous
obstacles in accessing complaints and
compensation mechanisms, such as the
Foreign Employment Welfare Fund.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment of men, women
and children continued to be perpetrated by
police, particularly during pre-trial detention,
to extract confessions and intimidate
individuals. In April, the UN Human Rights
Committee reminded Nepal of its obligation to
enact a law defining and criminalizing torture,
and to introduce effective sanctions and
remedies for the crime of torture and other ill-
treatment in line with international standards.
At the end of 2014 no action had been taken
to address these issues.
DISCRIMINATION
Discrimination, including on the basis of
gender, caste, class, ethnic origin and
religion, persisted. Victims were subject
to exclusion and ill-treatment, and torture
including rape and other sexual violence.
Women from marginalized groups, including
Dalits and impoverished women, continued to
face particular hardship because of multiple
forms of discrimination. The Caste-based
Discrimination and Untouchability Act of
2011 was applied in only a handful of
criminal cases due to a lack of awareness
about the Act and victims’ fears of reporting
attacks. Rape laws continued to be
inadequate and to reflect discriminatory
attitudes towards women.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE
RIGHTS AND RIGHT TO HEALTH
Women and girls in Nepal continued
to experience serious gender-based
discrimination. This limited their ability to
control their sexuality and make choices
related to reproduction, including use of
contraception; to challenge early marriages;
Amnesty International Report 2014/15to ensure adequate antenatal and maternal
health care; and to access sufficient nutritious
food. It also put them at risk of domestic
violence, including marital rape. One
consequence of these factors was that women
and girls continued to be at high risk of
developing the reproductive health condition
uterine prolapse, often at a very early age.
Government efforts to eradicate gender
discrimination against women and girls
continued to be ineffective in reducing
women’s risk of uterine prolapse. Despite
progress in reducing maternal mortality, the
unmet need for contraception remained
high and significant numbers of women
and girls were unable to access skilled
birth attendants. Disparities across ethnic
groups and geographical regions meant this
was a particular problem for Dalit women,
Muslim women and women living in the
Terai. The government’s Five Year Human
Rights National Action Plan expressed,
among other things, the intention of the
Ministry of Health and Population to
“adopt preventive measures to end uterine
prolapse.” This welcome step, however, did
not contain details on the measures or on
how the government planned to ensure their
implementation.
NETHERLANDS
Kingdom of the Netherlands
Head of state: King Willem-Alexander
Head of government: Mark Rutte
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Immigration detention
Although the number of people placed in
immigration detention was declining, migrants
without regular legal status continued to face
disproportionately long periods of detention
under excessively strict conditions. In
December 2013 the Minister for Security and
Justice made legislative proposals to reform
immigration detention. However, in February
2014, Amnesty International and 10 other
civil society organizations raised numerous
concerns about the draft legislation. In
October, the government opened a child-
friendly closed location for families with
children whose detention it deemed
unavoidable, instead of holding them in a
prison-like facility.
Refoulement
In June, the Council of State rejected
requests for asylum from three men from
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
men had given testimony to the International
Criminal Court in proceedings against a
Congolese former militia leader accused of
war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The men, who themselves face allegations of
having committed gross human rights abuses,
were returned to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo in July, despite the risk of torture
and the death penalty that they would face
there. 1
The Netherlands continued to deport
rejected asylum-seekers to Somalia, against
guidelines issued by UNHCR, the UN
refugee agency. In one case from November
2013, Ahmed Said was deported from the
Netherlands to Mogadishu and injured three
days later in a suicide bombing.
Economic, social and cultural rights
Irregular migrants continued to face long
periods of immigration detention under
excessively strict conditions. Concerns
were raised around ethnic profiling by law
enforcement agencies.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In October 2013, the European Committee
of Social Rights recommended that the
Netherlands introduce measures to meet
the needs of persons at immediate risk of
destitution in response to a complaint brought
by the Conference of European Churches
about the situation of migrants without
269regular legal status. No steps were taken to
implement the decision in 2014.
There were ongoing reports during the
year of migrants without regular status setting
up makeshift accommodation and facing
threats of eviction. In June, a pilot project in
Amsterdam to accommodate rejected asylum-
seekers was closed.

DISCRIMINATION – ETHNIC PROFILING
NGOs and intergovernmental bodies
continued to raise concerns about ethnic
profiling by law enforcement agencies, in
particular around the lack of clear guidelines
to avoid racial profiling, and on data
gathering in stop-and-search operations.
In response to criticism by the European
Commission against Racism and Intolerance
and Amnesty International, among others,
the Dutch government and the Dutch police
both explicitly rejected ethnic profiling as
discriminatory.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
On 6 September 2013 the Netherlands
Supreme Court found the Dutch state liable
for the deaths of three men during the
Srebrenica genocide. 2 Dutch troops serving
as UN peacekeepers in Srebrenica sent three
Bosniak Muslim men, part of a larger group of
over 300 men, away from a “safe area” on 13
July 1995, effectively handing them over to
Bosnian Serb forces, who killed the majority
of those handed over. In July, the Hague
District Court ruled that the Dutch state was
liable for the loss suffered by the families of
the more than 300 men and boys mentioned
above, but not for the acts of the Dutch troops
prior to the fall of Srebrenica, or the failure of
those troops to hold the “safe area”.
UNLAWFUL KILLINGS
In November, the European Court of
Human Rights ruled that the Netherlands’
investigation into the fatal shooting by army
personnel of an Iraqi civilian in June 2004 in
Iraq violated his right to life and awarded the
victim’s father compensation of €25,000.

NEW ZEALAND
New Zealand
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Jerry Mateparae
Head of government: John Key
Economic, social and cultural rights lacked
equal legal protection to civil and political
rights. Māori (Indigenous People) continued
to be over-represented in the prison system.
Family violence was widespread and levels
of child poverty remained high.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
The government did not respond formally
to recommendations made in the 2013
Constitutional Advisory Panel report to
improve the Bill of Rights Act.
New Zealand’s second UN Universal
Periodic Review took place in January
2014 where concerns included the lack
of human rights oversight in parliamentary
processes. New Zealand rejected many
recommendations to strengthen domestic
human rights protections. 1 Economic, social
and cultural rights lacked full protection
in domestic legislation, and remedies for
breaches remained inadequate.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
visited New Zealand in 2014 and expressed
Amnesty International Report 2014/15concern that Māori made up 50% of the total
prison population and 65% of the female
prison population, despite being only 15% of
the general population.
The Working Group underlined the
inadequacy of legal protections for 17-year-
olds, considered adults under criminal law,
and criticized New Zealand’s reservation to
Article 37(c) of the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child on the detention of youth
and adult offenders in the same facilities.
which significantly impacted rights to privacy
and freedom of movement. The extremely
limited time period for consideration of the bill
restricted public consultation and prohibited
a robust assessment of compliance with
international human rights standards. 2

WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S RIGHTS
The 2013 Technical Report on Child Poverty
found that 27% of New Zealand children
remained in poverty. Māori and Pacific Island
children were disproportionately represented
in child poverty statistics, highlighting
systemic discrimination.
Violence against women and children
remained high. Māori were over-represented
as both victims and perpetrators of domestic
violence. The Vulnerable Children Act 2014
aimed to protect children from violence but
there was no national plan of action to combat
domestic violence.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
New Zealand retained the option to enact
legislation to utilize offshore immigration
detention centres. Disparities remained in
the quality of services provided to refugees
who arrived under the humanitarian intake
of UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and
those arriving in the country spontaneously
and whose refugee claims were accepted by
the government.

NICARAGUA
Republic of Nicaragua
Head of state and government: Daniel Ortega
Saavedra
Changes introduced by the government to
the Comprehensive Law against Violence
against Women raised serious concerns. The
total ban on abortion remained in place.
BACKGROUND
Amendments to the Constitution entered into
force in February, allowing the President to
be elected with a simple majority. Restrictions
on consecutive presidential re-election were
also lifted.
In May, the UN Subcommittee on
Prevention of Torture expressed deep concern
at the situation of people deprived of liberty
in the country. Nicaragua’s human rights
record was assessed under the UN Universal
Periodic Review (UPR). The state accepted
recommendations relating to discrimination
against Indigenous Peoples and people of
African descent but rejected calls for the
decriminalization of abortion and to accede
271to additional international human rights
instruments.
On 19 July, people travelling home
after attending the Sandinista revolution
anniversary celebrations were shot at in two
separate incidents. Five people died and 19
were injured. In October, 12 men were tried
and sentenced to between two and 30 years’
imprisonment for the attack. Three of them
testified in court that they were tortured and
forced to give a confession, raising concerns
about the investigation and the fairness of
the trial.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Reforms passed in September 2013
weakened the effectiveness of the
Comprehensive Law against Violence against
Women (Law 779), introduced in 2012. As
a result of the reforms, women who filed
complaints about domestic violence may be
offered mediation with their attackers in cases
involving crimes punishable by less than five
years’ imprisonment, such as actual bodily
harm, the abduction of children, and threats.
This means that women may find themselves
having to face their attackers in the mediation
process, while those accused of committing
abuses may avoid being held to account for
their crimes. According to the NGO Women’s
Network against Violence, seven of the 47
women killed in the first six months of 2014
had been in mediation with their abusive
partner. An executive decree issued in July
further reinforced the mediation aspect of the
law and reduced the definition of femicide to
killings of women within relationships. The
executive decree raised concerns around the
use of mediation to redress violence against
women. Numerous legal challenges against
the decree were submitted to the Supreme
Court of Justice.
The total ban on all forms of abortion
remained in place. Since the total ban was
introduced in 2006, dozens of appeals
against it have been submitted to the
Supreme Court of Justice. However, the Court
had yet to rule on these appeals.
272
On 8 March, International Women’s Day,
a peaceful demonstration to highlight gender
inequalities and violence against women was
blocked by police. Women human rights
defenders claimed they had obtained the
necessary permission for the event and feared
it marked a further limitation on independent
civil society movements.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
No progress was made in investigating
alleged beatings of students and senior
citizen demonstrators in Managua in June
2013 by what appeared to be government
supporters, while the police stood by. More
than 100 students supported the protest by
senior citizen groups to demand a minimum
state pension.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
In March, Indigenous, Afro-descendant
and other groups expressed concern
at the government’s decision to grant a
licence for the construction of a major
infrastructure project known as the Gran
Canal Interoceánico, a channel connecting
the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Among
other concerns, the groups claimed that the
licence was granted without the free, prior or
informed consent of the Indigenous groups
whose territory the canal would cut across.
Works started in December, amid protests
that resulted in clashes with protesters
and included reports of police beatings
of detainees.
NIGER
Republic of Niger

Head of government: Brigi Rafini
A new government was appointed in
August 2013 incorporating members of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the opposition; but some of them resigned
later in protest at under-representation.
The government implemented strict
anti-terrorism security measures,
including restricted movement in certain
neighbourhoods of Niamey, the capital,
where foreign embassies were located.
Niger was hosting over 57,000 refugees at
the end of the year, including 16,000 as
a result of the 2013 Mali conflict and the
ongoing violence in northeastern Nigeria.
protest against the arrests. The students were
charged with acts of vandalism and attacks
on public property and were on provisional
release at the end of the year.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION – HUMAN
RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND JOURNALISTS
In May, more than 30 members of the
political opposition, the Nigerien Democratic
Movement for an African Federation, were
arrested. The arrests happened in connection
with an investigation into shots fired at the
home of a deputy of the party in power, the
Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism,
and a Molotov cocktail attack on the party’s
headquarters. They were detained for two
weeks to three months and charged with
undermining the authority of the State. A trial
had not been held by the end of the year. In January, two journalists, including
Soumana Idrissa Maïga, director of the private
daily L’Enquêteur, were held in police custody
for 96 hours in Niamey and charged with
plotting against state security after publishing
an article which reported that certain persons
were saying the days of the administration
were numbered. No trial had been organized
at the end of the year.
In July, Ali Idrissa, co-ordinator for the
civil society network Publish What You Pay,
was taken into police custody twice following
a press conference during which he called
on the French mining company AREVA to
respect Niger’s mining laws and denounced
aspects of the France-Niger relationship as
neo-colonial. A further 10 civil society leaders
were also arrested in Niamey on 18 July and
released the same evening.
ARMED CONFLICT INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Armed groups, including the Movement
for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa and
Boko Haram, perpetrated attacks in different
locations around the country during 2013 and
2014, including attacks against civilians.
In October, armed groups launched
simultaneous attacks on a security post of the
Mangaïzé camp for Malian refugees, Ouallam
prison, and a military patrol at Bani Bangou,
all in the Tillabéry region near the border with
Mali. At least nine members of the security
forces were killed. In March, Colonel Mu’ammar al-Gaddafi’s
son, Saadi al-Gaddafi, was extradited to Libya.
He had stayed in Niger on “humanitarian
grounds” since September 2012. There were
serious concerns over the Libyan authorities’
ability to ensure a fair trial before an ordinary
civilian court in this and other similar cases
of al-Gaddafi loyalists, and that his trial may
result in the death penalty.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
In May, student demonstrations took place
over the late payment of scholarships. The
police used excessive force to repress the
protest. At least 30 students were injured and
72 were arrested and released after 19 days
of detention. There was a hunger strike to

273NIGERIA
Federal Republic of Nigeria
Head of state and government: Goodluck Ebele
Jonathan
Crimes under international law and serious
human rights violations and abuses were
committed by both sides in the conflict
between the Nigerian military and the armed
group Boko Haram, which escalated during
the year. Torture and other ill-treatment
by the police and security forces was
widespread. A law criminalizing marriage or
civil union and public displays of affection
between same-sex couples came into force.
Freedom of expression was restricted. The
death penalty continued to be applied.
BACKGROUND
Preparations for general elections in February
2015, a five-month national conference of
governmental, political and public figures,
and the conflict between the government and
Boko Haram dominated events during the
year. The ruling People’s Democratic Party
(PDP) and the All Progressives Congress
(APC), formed in February 2013 from
several opposition parties, were the main
parties campaigning for the 2015 election.
Rivers State saw clashes in January and
July between supporters and opponents of
Governor Rotimi Amaechi, who defected
to the APC in late 2013. The police were
criticized for a perceived pro-PDP bias in
their handling of the protests. Civil society
organizations reported that politicians had
begun to arm their supporters.
Between March and August, almost 500
prominent public figures gathered to discuss
the state of Nigeria. The process, described
as a “national conference”, recommended
over 600 constitutional, law and policy
reforms, including the creation of new states
and an increase in the portion of government
revenue allocated to state governments.
274
A seven-member presidential panel is
considering the conference’s report and will
advise the government on how to implement
the recommendations.
Boko Haram increased its attacks on towns
in the northeast of the country and captured
major towns across three states. The state
of emergency in Adamawa, Borno and
Yobe, the states most affected by violence,
was extended in May but not renewed
in November.
ARMED CONFLICT
Boko Haram
Violent attacks by the armed group Boko
Haram against government and civilian
targets escalated. From July onwards Boko
Haram captured and occupied more than
20 towns across Adamawa, Borno and Yobe
states, targeting and killing several thousand
civilians in towns across the northeast, in
areas under the group’s control, and in
bomb attacks nationwide. In attacks on
towns Boko Haram often abducted young
women and girls, including 276 girls from
Chibok town in April. Boko Haram forced
abducted women and girls into marriage,
forcibly recruited men, and tortured people
living under its control who violated its
rules. The group looted markets, shops and
homes and deliberately targeted schools and
other civilian facilities. Some of these acts
amount to war crimes and crimes against
humanity. The authorities failed to adequately
investigate killings and abductions, bring
suspected perpetrators to justice or prevent
further attacks.
On 25 February, at least 43 people were
shot dead by Boko Haram gunmen in an
attack on a school in Buni Yadi, Yobe State.
Many schoolchildren were among those killed
in the attack.
On 14 April and 1 May, Boko Haram
carried out car bomb attacks in Nyanya, a
suburb of the capital Abuja, killing more than
70 people in the first attack and 19 people in
the second, with more than 60 injured.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 14 April, 276 girls were abducted by
Boko Haram from the Government Girls
Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State.
Nigerian security forces had more than four
hours’ advance warning about the attack on
Chibok, but failed to act.
On 5 May, Boko Haram killed at least
393 people in an attack in Gamborou Ngala,
Borno State. The overwhelming majority of the
casualties were civilians. Boko Haram burned
market stalls, vehicles and nearby homes
and shops.
On 6 August, Boko Haram captured
the town of Gwoza and killed at least 600
civilians, although several sources suggested
the figure was higher.
Boko Haram attacked and captured Bama
town on 1 September, killing more than 50
civilians. According to eyewitnesses, the
group imprisoned and later killed as many
as 300 men and forced 30 women to marry
its members.
On 28 November, three bombs exploded
outside a mosque in Kano city and armed
men, suspected to be Boko Haram fighters,
fired into the crowd. At least 81 people died
in the attack.
Boko Haram killed 24 people and
abducted more than 110 children and young
men and women in two attacks on Gumsuri
village on 12 and 14 December.
Security forces
In responding to Boko Haram, Nigerian
security forces committed grave human rights
violations and acts which constitute crimes
under international law.
Arbitrary arrests by the military continued
in northeast Nigeria. The military was known
to enter communities, forcing the men to sit
down outside in front of an informant in order
to identify suspected Boko Haram members.
Those singled out were detained by the
military. In November the Nigerian military
released at least 167 detainees from custody,
a small portion of those arrested.
Detainees were denied access to the
outside world, including lawyers, courts and
families, and were held outside the protection
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
of the law. Detainees were usually not
informed of the reason for their arrest; their
families were not given information about their
fate or whereabouts. By the end of the year
few, if any, of those detained by the military
were brought before a court or permitted to
challenge the lawfulness of their detention.
Many of those detained appeared to
have been subjected to torture or other
ill-treatment, as part of interrogations
or as punishment. Detainees continued
to die in military detention facilities as
a result of torture or extremely harsh
detention conditions.
The government failed to investigate
deaths in custody and denied the National
Human Rights Commission access to military
detention facilities.
On 14 March, Boko Haram gunmen
attacked the Giwa military barracks in the
town of Maiduguri, freeing several hundred
detainees. Witnesses said that as the military
regained control of the barracks, more than
640 people, mostly unarmed recaptured
detainees, were extrajudicially executed in
various locations in and around Maiduguri.
One of those executions, captured in footage,
shows people who appear to be members
of the Nigerian military and the Civilian Joint
Task Force (“Civilian” JTF) using a blade
to slit the throats of five detainees, before
dumping them in an open mass grave. Nine
people were killed this way and, according to
witnesses, other detainees seen in the video
were shot.
The government announced investigations
into the 14 March events. However, the
mandate, composition or timeline of the
panels of inquiry had not been made public
by the end of the year.
Nigerian security forces repeatedly carried
out extrajudicial executions, often following
the “screening” of suspects. For example,
on 23 July 2013 the Nigerian armed forces
and the “Civilian” JTF entered Bama central
market and told all adult men in the vicinity to
gather in one area and take off their clothes.
The men were put into two groups – one
275group of around 35 men were designated,
seemingly at random, as Boko Haram
members and another group of up to 300
deemed to be innocent. A video showed the
alleged Boko Haram members lying down
side by side on the ground, being beaten
with sticks and machetes by members of
the military and “Civilian” JTF. Eyewitnesses
confirmed that the 35 captives were loaded
onto a single military vehicle and taken away
to the local military barracks in Bama. On
the afternoon of 29 July, military personnel
took the men out of the barracks and brought
them to their communities, where they shot
them dead, several at a time, before dumping
their bodies. All 35 captives were killed.
Refugees and internally displaced people
The humanitarian situation in the northeast
deteriorated as a result of the violence.
Since May 2013, at least 1.5 million people,
mainly women, children and elderly people,
were forced to flee to other parts of Nigeria
or seek refuge in neighbouring countries.
Families were separated, children were
unable to attend school and many people
were denied their source of livelihood. Host
communities, government authorities and
international organizations struggled to meet
the humanitarian needs of displaced people.
Two towns, Maiduguri and Biu, experienced
cholera outbreaks in camps for the internally
displaced, resulting in more than 100 deaths.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The use of torture remained widespread
and routine within Nigeria’s police and
military. Countless people were subjected to
physical and psychological torture and other
ill-treatment. Suspects in police and military
custody across the country were subjected
to torture as punishment or to extract
“confessions”, particularly in cases involving
armed robbery and murder, or related to
Boko Haram.
Many police divisions in different states,
including the Special Anti-Robbery Squad
(SARS) and Criminal Investigation Division
(CID), kept “torture chambers” for use

detention were routine. Women detained for
criminal offences, women relatives of criminal
suspects, sex workers and women believed to
be sex workers were often targeted for rape
and other sexual violence by police officers.
Children under the age of 18 were also
detained and tortured or otherwise ill-treated
in police stations.
HOUSING RIGHTS
In March, before the UN Human Rights
Council, Nigeria reaffirmed its commitments
to its international human rights obligations
on the rights to adequate housing and
effective remedy. Despite this, the Lagos state
government violated the right to effective
remedy of close to 9,000 people affected by
a forced eviction in Badia East, Lagos State,
in February 2013. 1 After mounting pressure
and over a year after rendering thousands
homeless, the Lagos state government
provided some affected people with limited
financial assistance instead of adequate
compensation for their losses. Furthermore,
in order to access the financial assistance
the government required people to sign
documents that effectively prevented them
from accessing further remedy.
In June the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Court awarded
almost US$70,000 in damages to members
of the Bundu community in relation to an
incident on 12 October 2009: armed security
forces had opened fire on unarmed protesters
in an informal settlement in Port Harcourt,
killing one and seriously injuring 12 others.
The protesters were demonstrating against
plans to demolish their homes. The Court
held that there was no justification for the
shootings and the government had breached
its obligation to protect and respect the right
to peaceful association and assembly.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The criminal justice system remained
under-resourced, blighted by corruption and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15generally distrusted. Security forces often
resorted to dragnet arrests instead of arresting
individuals based on reasonable suspicion.
Suspects were regularly subjected to inhuman
and degrading treatment in detention.
In the past decade, at least five presidential
committees and working groups on
reforming the criminal justice system have
been set up. However, the majority of their
recommendations – including on combating
torture – had not been implemented by the
end of the year.
The Nigerian Police Force issued a Human
Rights Practice Manual on 10 December,
setting out standards expected of police
officers and guidance on how to achieve
these standards.
DEATH PENALTY
Nigeria continued to sentence people to
death; no executions were carried out. During
the adoption of the Universal Periodic Review
outcomes of Nigeria at the UN Human Rights
Council in March, Nigeria stated that it would
continue with a national dialogue on the
abolition of the death penalty.
In June 2014, the ECOWAS Court of Justice
ordered Nigeria to remove from death row
Thankgod Ebhos, who had not exhausted his
right of appeal, and Maimuna Abdulmumini,
who was a minor at the time of the alleged
offence. In October 2014, after 19 years
on death row and having narrowly escaped
execution in June 2013, Thankgod Ebhos
was released under an order issued by the
Governor of Kaduna State. Four other men
were executed in June 2013, the first known
executions in the country since 2006.
Courts martial in September and December
convicted a total of 70 soldiers of mutiny and
sentenced them all to death.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Security forces curtailed freedom of
expression during the year.
Over three days in June the military and
the Department of State Security seized and
destroyed several newspapers and searched
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
newspaper delivery vans. The Defence
Headquarters stated that the action had been
in the interests of national security.
In August soldiers briefly detained two
managers at the Daily Trust newspaper’s
Maiduguri offices, reportedly after the paper
published a story claiming that soldiers had
refused orders to fight Boko Haram.
In October police arrested Africa
Independent Television journalist Amaechi
Anakwe after he called an Assistant Inspector
General of Police “controversial” on television.
A court discharged him the following day.
COMMUNAL VIOLENCE
Communal violence occurred in many parts
of the country, particularly in the Middle Belt
area. The NGO International Crisis Group
(ICG) estimated that, between January and
July, more than 900 people were killed in
intercommunal violence in the states of
Kaduna, Katsina, Plateau, Zamfara, Taraba,
Nasarawa and Benue.
On 14 and 15 March, gunmen thought
to be Fulani herdsmen killed about 200
people in three villages in Kaduna State.
Around 200 people were also killed in
clashes between gunmen and local vigilante
groups in Unguwar Galadima, Zamfara
State, over two days in April. In August at
least 60 people died in fighting between
Fulani herdsmen and ethnic Eggon farmers
in Nasarawa State. In another incident in
the area in November, at least 40 people
lost their lives in clashes between the Eggon
and Gwadara ethnic groups over a piece of
land. In April, 25 people died in Andoyaku in
Taraba State when attackers burned down the
entire village.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In January, President Jonathan signed into
law the 2013 Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition)
Act. The law criminalizes marriage or civil
union for same-sex couples; the solemnization
of same-sex marriage in places of worship;
public displays of affection between same-sex
277couples; and the registration and support of
gay clubs and societies in Nigeria. The law
provides for sentences of between 10 to 14
years’ imprisonment.
Days after the law came into force,
lesbians, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex (LGBTI) people and activists faced
harassment, blackmail and threats to their
lives. In Ibadan, Oyo State, police arrested
five men on the basis of their perceived
sexual orientation. They were later released
on bail. In Awka, Anambra State, six people
were reportedly arrested and detained by
police under the new law. An Assistant
Commissioner of Police in Bauchi said that
police carried a list of suspected LGBTI
people “under surveillance” as part of their
“profiling of criminals”.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
Pollution from oil industry operations
continued to cause environmental devastation
and destroy livelihoods in the Niger Delta
region. Hundreds of oil spills occurred in both
2013 and 2014, caused by the failure of oil
company equipment, and by sabotage and oil
theft. Oil companies continued to blame the
vast majority of oil spills on sabotage and theft
despite growing evidence of old and badly
maintained pipelines and serious flaws in the
oil spill investigation process which is led by
the oil companies.
There were frequent delays in stopping
and cleaning up oil spills. Clean-up processes
continued to be inadequate.
NGOs continued to raise concerns over the
failure of the government and the oil company
Shell to implement the recommendations
made by the 2011 UN Environment
Programme (UNEP) scientific study on
pollution in the Ogoniland region of the Niger
Delta. Although the government continued
to provide some drinking water to people
whose water sources had been polluted by
oil spills, the amount and quality of the water
was widely reported to be inadequate. In
September 2014, the Ministry of Petroleum
initiated a multi-stakeholder process on the
278
UNEP report, and established four working
groups tasked with implementing different
aspects of the recommendations.
A legal action against the oil company
Shell, taken in the UK by people from the
Bodo community where two massive oil
spills from an old and leaking Shell pipeline
devastated the area in 2008 and 2009,
concluded in December with an out-of-court
settlement. Shell paid £55 million (US$83
million) to the community. However, the
damage caused by the two spills had not
been properly cleaned up by the end of
the year.
Court documents demonstrated that Shell
had repeatedly made false claims about the
size and impact of the two spills in the Bodo
community in an attempt to minimize its
compensation payments. The documents
also showed that Shell had known for years
that its Niger Delta pipelines were old and
faulty. Using the same documents, the NGO
Friends of the Earth Netherlands claimed
that Shell had also lied to a Dutch court in a
separate legal action over oil pollution in the
Niger Delta.
Numerous oil spills occurred in the
Ikarama area and other parts of Bayelsa
State, from both Shell and ENI/Agip
operations. A civil society group working
with the local communities, Shareholders
Alliance for Corporate Accountability (SACA),
expressed concern about flawed clean-up
and compensation processes in the area
and the failure of oil companies to provide
adequate security to protect their oil facilities
from sabotage.
In November, the National Assembly’s
House of Representatives Committee on
Environment recommended that Shell
Nigerian Exploration and Production Company
should pay damages of US$3.6 billion for
losses incurred by coastal communities in
Bayelsa State during the 2011 Bonga oil spill
which reportedly affected 350 communities
and satellite towns.

Head of state: King Harald V
Head of government: Erna Solberg
Transgender people continued to face
significant obstacles to legal gender
recognition. Impunity for rape and sexual
violence continued to be the norm.
DISCRIMINATION –
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
Transgender people could only obtain
legal recognition of their gender following a
psychiatric diagnosis, compulsory hormone
therapy and gender reassignment surgery
including irreversible sterilization. 1 In
December 2013, the Directorate of Health
established an expert group composed
of health professionals, legal experts and
representatives of transgender organizations.
It was tasked to develop recommendations
on legal gender recognition and access to
health care for transgender people by 25
February 2015.
In March, John Jeanette Solstad Remø
applied to the Ministry of Health and
Care Services to change her legal gender.
The Ministry refused her request. In
September, the Office of the Equality and
Anti-Discrimination Ombud stated that
the Ministry’s requirement for diagnosis,
hormone therapy and gender reassignment
surgery including irreversible sterilization
was discriminatory and breached the
law against discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation, gender identity and
gender expression.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
The first national study on the prevalence
of rape and sexual violence, published in
February, confirmed rape to be a widespread
and gendered crime. Nearly one in 10
surveyed women reported having been raped.
Half of the victims reported experiencing
rape before the age of 18. The report
documented that one in three victims had
never told anyone about the abuse, and
only one in 10 rapes had been reported to
the police. Half of those who had reported
being raped considered that the police had
not investigated the crime. Police statistics
indicated that eight out of 10 reported rape
cases were dropped at various stages of
the legal process, reinforcing longstanding
concerns about attrition in rape prosecutions.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In October 2013, the government announced
an amnesty for up to 578 minor children
of asylum-seekers whose applications for
asylum had been finally rejected and who
had been in the country for over three years.
NGOs criticized its restricted application
to only children from countries with which
Norway has a readmission agreement,
arguing that such an arbitrary criterion was
discriminatory and undermined the principle
of best interests of the child. In April, the
Minister of Justice stated publicly that only
130 out of the 578 children would be covered
by the amnesty. In a new consultation
paper issued in June, the Ministry of Justice
proposed additional conditions on access to
the scheme.
On 18 December, the Immigration Appeals
Board announced that it was suspending all
forced and voluntary returns to Uzbekistan of
asylum-seekers whose applications had been
finally rejected.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
The appeal by a 47-year-old Rwandan
national against his conviction for murder
during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
remained outstanding at the end of the year.
279On 14 February 2013, the Oslo District Court
sentenced him to 21 years’ imprisonment. He
was convicted of premeditated murder under
especially aggravating circumstances, but not
of genocide, as the article defining the latter
only entered into force in 2008 and does not
have retrospective effect.
BACKGROUND
Following Norway’s ratification of the Optional
Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture
in 2013, the National Preventive Mechanism,
taken on by the Parliamentary Ombudsman,
was fully operational by April 2014. The
Mechanism was created with an advisory
committee of members from the National
Institution for Human Rights, the other
Ombudspersons and civil society and NGO
representatives. In January, Oman ratified the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Security
Agreement, the provisions of which
jeopardized freedom of expression and
other individual rights guaranteed in Oman’s
Constitution and in international treaties.
The government decreed a new citizenship
law in August, to take effect in February
2015. It empowered the authorities to strip
Omani nationals of their citizenship and
associated rights if they are found to belong
to a group deemed to uphold principles
or beliefs that undermine Oman’s “best
interests”, potentially allowing the government
to arbitrarily withdraw the nationality of and
expel its critics.
Also in August, Oman ratified the 1997
Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention.

OMAN
Sultanate of Oman
Head of state and government: Sultan Qaboos bin
Said
State authorities continued to restrict
freedom of expression, including in the
media and online. Freedom of assembly was
not permitted. Several government critics
were detained and held incommunicado for
some weeks. Authorities forcibly returned
a political activist to Bahrain despite a risk
that he would face torture there. Women
continued to face discrimination in law and
practice. The death penalty remained in
force; no executions were reported.
280
On 27 January, the Omani authorities
arrested Bahraini actor and political activist
Sadeq Ja’far Mansoor al-Sha’bani and forcibly
returned him to Bahrain despite fears that
he may be tortured there. He subsequently
received a five-year prison sentence in
Bahrain along with eight others on charges
including “inciting hatred of the regime”.
In May, police arrested and detained
several men, who were subsequently
released on 12 July after they reportedly
signed pledges not to participate in advocacy
activities or incite sectarianism. Two bloggers
who criticized the authorities online were
arrested in July and released without charge
after several weeks.
In August, Dr Talib al-Ma’mari, a member
of the Shura Council, and Saqr al-Balushi, a
councillor in the city of Liwa, were sentenced
to four years’ and one year’s imprisonment
respectively, on charges including “public
gathering with the aim of disturbing law
and order” and “closing a road”. The two
men had participated in an anti-pollution
demonstration in Liwa in August 2013.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Following a six-day visit to Oman in
September, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and
of association stated that limits on peaceful
assembly in Oman were “quite restrictive, to
the point where they often annul the essence
of the right”. PAKISTAN
WOMEN’S RIGHTS In December, the Pakistani Taliban-led
attack on the Army Public School in
Peshawar resulted in 149 deaths, including
132 children, marking the deadliest terrorist
attack in Pakistan’s history. In response,
the government lifted the moratorium on
carrying out death sentences and swiftly
executed seven men previously convicted
for other terror-related offences. The Prime
Minister announced plans for allowing
military courts to try terror suspects as
part of the government’s National Action
Plan against terrorism, adding to concerns
over fair trials. In October education
rights activist Malala Yousafzai jointly won
the Nobel Peace Prize in October along
with Indian child rights activist Kailash
Satyarthi. The National Assembly approved
the Protection of Pakistan Act in July
and other security laws during the year
that enshrined sweeping powers for law
enforcement and security forces, expanding
the scope for arbitrary arrests, indefinite
detention, the use of lethal force, and
secret court proceedings which go well
beyond international law enforcement and
fair trial standards. Pakistan’s media faced
sustained harassment and other abuse, and
the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory
Authority briefly ordered the closure of the
two largest private broadcasters because of
content critical of the authorities. Religious
minorities continued to face discrimination
and persecution, especially due to the
blasphemy laws.
Women were not accorded equal rights with
men under the criminal law, which attached
less weight to the evidence of a woman than
to the evidence of a man, and under personal
status law, which accorded men greater
rights in relation to divorce, child custody and
inheritance.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Migrant workers received inadequate
protection under labour laws and faced
exploitation and abuse. In May and
November,, the government renewed
for a further six months a bar on the
entry of most foreign migrant workers for
construction and other work sectors. In July,
a new decree amended the labour law to
prevent the employment of expatriates in
professions reserved for Omani nationals. The
government also stated that it would begin to
strictly enforce a rule barring migrant workers
who leave Oman from returning for two
years, which was reported to facilitate labour
exploitation.
DEATH PENALTY
Oman retained the death penalty for murder
and other offences. In June, the State
Council approved proposals to extend its use
to drug trafficking offences. No executions
were reported.
Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Head of state: Mamnoon Hussain
Head of government: Muhammad Nawaz Sharif
BACKGROUND
Hearings in the treason trial of former military
ruler General Pervez Musharraf continued to
be delayed, creating tensions between the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
281democratically elected government of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and the powerful
military. The government and opposition
political parties failed to secure a peace deal
with the Pakistani Taliban, culminating in
the latter carrying out an attack on Karachi
International Airport that claimed at least 34
lives, mostly of security forces and Taliban
fighters. That attack and continued pressure
from the USA resulted in the Pakistan Army
launching a major military operation against
Taliban and al-Qa’ida sanctuaries in North
Waziristan tribal agency in June, which was
continuing as of the end of 2014.
Following their claims of rigging in the
2013 general elections, and disaffection
with independent inquiries into these claims,
demonstrators led by the opposition politician
Imran Khan and the religious cleric Tahir ul
Qadri held protests across the country calling
on the government of Nawaz Sharif to step
down and for fresh elections. After the killing
of 12 political activists by police in Lahore’s
Model Town neighbourhood on 17 June, the
protests became increasingly confrontational,
peaking in August and September.
Demonstrators briefly stormed the National
Assembly and threatened to occupy the
Prime Minister’s official residence, creating
a crisis that risked forcing the collapse of the
government, until the military publicly backed
the Prime Minister.
For the fourth year in a row major
floods across Pakistan displaced
hundreds of thousands, creating a major
humanitarian crisis.
Attempts by the government to improve
relations with India early in the year stalled
as the armed forces of the two countries
engaged in regular clashes across the Line of
Control across Jammu and Kashmir.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Armed groups were implicated in human
rights abuses across the country. On 16
December, several men claimed by the
Pakistani Taliban as its members attacked
the Army Public School in the northwestern
282
city of Peshawar, where 149 people were
killed, 132 of them children, and dozens
injured in shootings and suicide bombings.
The Pakistani Taliban said the attack was in
response to recent Pakistan Army operations
in nearby North Waziristan in which hundreds
of Taliban fighters had been killed.
Various factions of the Pakistani Taliban
continued to carry out attacks, including
against activists and journalists for promoting
education and other rights, or for criticizing
them. Ahrar ul Hind, a breakaway group from
the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility
for the 3 March gun and suicide bomb attack
on a court house in Islamabad that left 11
dead and several others injured, reportedly in
response to the Pakistani Taliban’s decision to
enter peace talks with the government. Jamat
ul Ahrar, another breakaway group from
the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility
for the 2 November suicide bomb attack
following the daily flag lowering parade at
the Wagah Border Post between Pakistan
and India, which left 61 dead and more than
100 injured.
Health workers involved in polio and other
vaccination campaigns were killed in various
parts of the country. Killings were particularly
prevalent in parts of the northwest and the
city of Karachi, areas with an active presence
of Taliban and aligned groups which oppose
vaccinations. Ethnic Baloch armed groups
calling for a separate state of Balochistan
were implicated in the killing and abduction
of security forces and others on the basis of
their ethnic or political affiliations, and carried
out attacks on infrastructure. The anti-Shi’a
armed group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed
responsibility for a series of assassinations
and other attacks on the Shi’a Muslim
population, particularly in the province of
Balochistan and the cities of Karachi and
Lahore. Rival armed groups frequently
clashed, resulting in scores of fatalities.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Despite clear rulings by the Supreme Court
to the government in 2013 demanding
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the recovery of victims of enforced
disappearances, the authorities did little
to meet its obligations under international
law and the Constitution to prevent these
violations. The practices of state security
forces, including actions within the scope
of laws such as the Protection of Pakistan
Act, resulted in men and boys being
subjected to enforced disappearance across
Pakistan and particularly in the provinces
of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and
Sindh. Several victims were later found dead,
bearing what appeared to be bullet wounds
and torture marks. The government did not
implement Supreme Court orders calling
for security forces responsible for enforced
disappearances to be brought to justice.
Zahid Baloch, Chairman of the Baloch
Student Organisation-Azad, was abducted in
Quetta, Balochistan, on 18 March. Witnesses
claimed he was taken at gunpoint in the
city’s Satellite Town area by personnel of the
Frontier Corps, a federal security force. The
authorities denied knowledge of his arrest and
failed to investigate his fate or whereabouts
or to investigate the abduction adequately.
No new information was known at the end of
the year. 1
The bodies of men and boys arbitrarily
detained by the Pakistan armed forces in
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)
continued to be recovered months or years
later, while the authorities generally failed to
abide by Peshawar High Court orders either
to release those suspected of terrorism or
charge them promptly and bring them to
trial. Detainees continued to have limited
access to families and lawyers. There were
some rare instances of activists subjected
to enforced disappearance being returned
alive. On 5 February, Kareem Khan, an anti-
drone activist and a relative of victims, was
abducted by up to 20 armed men, some in
police uniforms, from his home in the garrison
city of Rawalpindi, days before he was due
to travel to Europe to give testimony before
the European Parliament on the impact of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
US drone strikes on Pakistan’s tribal areas.
He was released nine days later following
pressure from local and international rights
groups and foreign governments. He claimed
that he had been subjected to torture and
repeatedly questioned about his activism
and his investigation of drone strikes.
The authorities failed to investigate the
incident adequately and did not bring those
responsible to justice.
Human rights groups criticized a judicial
inquiry into mass graves discovered in Totak
Balochistan on 25 January for failing to
investigate state security forces adequately.
Baloch activists claimed that the graves
belonged to ethnic Baloch activists who had
been subjected to enforced disappearance. 2
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
Parts of FATA in northwestern Pakistan
continued to be affected by internal armed
conflict, facing regular attacks by the Taliban
and other armed groups, the Pakistan armed
forces, and US drone aircraft that claimed
hundreds of lives. In June the Pakistan
Army launched a major military operation
in North Waziristan tribal agency, and
carried out sporadic operations in Khyber
tribal agency and other parts of FATA.
Affected communities routinely complained
of the disproportionate use of force and
indiscriminate attacks by all sides to the
conflict, especially the Pakistan armed
forces. The fighting displaced over a million
residents, most of whom were forced to
flee to the district of Bannu in neighbouring
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province during the
hottest period of the year. US drone strikes
continued sporadically from 11 June onwards
after a hiatus of nearly six months, reigniting
concerns of unlawful killings. On 5 June the
Islamabad High Court ordered the arrest of a
former CIA station chief for Pakistan over his
alleged responsibility for unlawful killings due
to pilotless drone aircraft in the tribal areas.
On 12 September, security forces announced
the arrest in North Waziristan of 10 men
allegedly involved in the 2012 assassination
283attempt on education rights activist Malala
Yousafzai. Questions remained as to how they
were arrested, their treatment in detention
and whether they would receive a fair trial.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
– JOURNALISTS
At least eight journalists were killed across
Pakistan during the year in direct response to
their work, marking the country out as one of
the most dangerous in the world for the media
profession. 3 High-profile television anchor
Hamid Mir claimed that the Directorate for
Inter-Services Intelligence, the most powerful
intelligence service, was responsible for
an attempt on his life which he narrowly
escaped in Karachi on 19 April. Following
the claims, which were broadcast nationally
by Hamid Mir’s television station Geo TV, the
broadcaster was formally suspended for 15
days on 6 June. Several journalists associated
with the outlet received daily threats and
harassment by unidentified individuals
by phone and in person. Many refused to
enter their offices or identify themselves as
belonging to Geo TV or associated media for
fear of being attacked.
On 20 October, Geo TV’s main rival, ARY
News, was also suspended after the Lahore
High Court held that the broadcaster and
some of its journalists had been in contempt
of court for airing the views of an individual
facing trial before the court.
In March, the Prime Minister promised
to appoint special public prosecutors to
investigate attacks on journalists, and he
personally visited Hamid Mir in hospital after
the attempt on his life. No one had been
brought to justice for this attempted killing or
any other attack on journalists at the end of
the year. 4
DISCRIMINATION –
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES
Religious minorities continued to face
laws and practices that resulted in their
discrimination and persecution. Dozens
of ethnic Hazaras were killed in attacks in
284
Quetta and other parts of Balochistan; the
armed group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed
responsibility for many of these, saying
they were because the Hazaras were Shi’a
Muslims. Members of the Sikh religious
community staged several protests throughout
the year against killings, abductions and
attacks on their places of worship in different
parts of the country. They complained that
the authorities consistently failed to provide
adequate protection from such attacks or
bring those responsible to justice.
The blasphemy laws remained in force, in
violation of the rights to freedom of thought,
conscience and religion and freedom of
opinion and expression. Abuse connected
with the blasphemy laws occurred regularly
during the year as demonstrated in several
high-profile cases. Renowned human rights
lawyer Rashid Rehman was shot dead in
front of colleagues in his office in the city of
Multan, Punjab province, on 7 May. Prior
to his killing, Rashid Rehman had received
regular death threats because of his legal
representation of a university teacher, Junaid
Hafeez, who had been arrested on charges
of blasphemy. On 18 September Professor
Muhammad Shakil Auj, a noted religious
scholar and dean of Islamic Studies at
Karachi University, was gunned down by
unidentified assailants while travelling to a
meeting. He had faced death threats and
charges of blasphemy from rival religious
scholars in the months prior to his killing.
A mob burned down the homes of a small
Ahmadiyya community in Punjab province on
the evening of 27 July, after a resident was
accused of blasphemy – two children and
their grandmother died of smoke inhalation
and several others were seriously injured. On
16 October the appeal bench of the Lahore
High Court rejected an application by a
Christian woman, Asia Bibi, to have her 2010
death sentence for blasphemy overturned. 5
In March, a Christian road sweeper, Savan
Masih, was sentenced to death for blasphemy
after a friend accused him of making
blasphemous remarks during an argument.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15The accusations provoked a two-day riot
in his neighbourhood in Lahore, known as
Joseph Colony, when a 3,000-strong mob
burned around 200 homes of Christians.
Police were warned of the impending attack
but failed to take adequate measures to
protect the community.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
A handful of high-profile so-called “honour”
killing cases highlighted the risks to women
from their own families for seeking to marry
partners of their choice. On 27 May, Farzana
Parveen was shot and beaten to death with
a brick by members of her family, including
her father and her ex-husband, outside the
entrance to the Lahore High Court, after she
had fled and married a man of her choosing.
Several of her male relatives were arrested for
the killing, as, separately, was her husband,
Mohammad Iqbal, after he admitted to
killing his first wife in order to be with
Farzana Parveen.
Women also risked abuse while seeking
to exercise their rights. For example, in
September a jirga (traditional decision-making
body) of male Uthmanzai tribal chiefs from
North Waziristan tribal agency threatened
women with violence for seeking access
to humanitarian assistance in displaced
persons camps in Bannu district of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province, where the vast
majority of people fleeing the conflict in the
tribal agency were based.
DEATH PENALTY
The attack on the Army Public School
in Peshawar on 16 December led to a
resumption of executions after the six-year
moratorium was lifted by Prime Minister
Sharif. He announced plans for the execution
of 500 people convicted for other terrorism-
related offences. Seven men convicted
previously were hanged in December in a
swift series of executions, after President
Hussain summarily rejected their appeals.
The government also announced plans for
early 2015 for the use of military courts in
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
trying terror suspects, as part of its National
Action Plan against terrorism.
People continued to be sentenced to
death. Shoaib Sarwar, a death row prisoner
convicted of murder in 1998, was ordered to
be executed in September after exhausting
all his appeals. However, the execution was
postponed several times by the authorities
under pressure from anti-death penalty
campaigners at home and abroad. 6

PALESTINE
(STATE OF)
State of Palestine
Head of state: Mahmoud Abbas
Head of government: Rami Hamdallah
Authorities in the West Bank and Gaza
restricted freedoms of expression and
peaceful assembly, carried out arbitrary
arrests and detentions, and tortured
285and otherwise ill-treated detainees
with impunity. Women and girls faced
discrimination in law and practice, and were
inadequately protected against gender-based
violence. The death penalty remained in
force; there were no executions in the West
Bank, but the Hamas authorities in Gaza,
who continued to try civilians before unfair
military courts, carried out at least two
executions. Hamas forces in Gaza carried
out at least 22 extrajudicial executions
of people they accused of “collaborating”
with Israel. Israel’s Protective Edge military
offensive killed more than 1,500 civilians in
Gaza, wounded thousands more, and caused
huge devastation, exacerbating the hardship
felt by Gaza’s 1.8 million inhabitants due
to Israel’s continuing military blockade of
the territory. During the 50-day conflict,
Hamas and Palestinian armed groups fired
thousands of indiscriminate rockets and
mortar rounds into civilian areas of Israel,
killing six civilians, including one child.
BACKGROUND
US-convened negotiations, which began in
2013 and aimed to resolve the decades-long
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, concluded at the
end of April without reaching any agreement.
The same month, Fatah, the ruling
party of the Palestinian Authority, which
administers the West Bank, and Hamas, the
de facto administration in Gaza since 2007,
announced a unity agreement. In June,
Fatah, Hamas and other Palestinian factions
agreed to a national reconciliation government
of independent technocrats to run civilian
affairs in both areas until parliamentary and
presidential elections take place. No date for
elections had been set by the end of the year.
There was growing international recognition
of Palestinian statehood, despite opposition
from Israel and the USA. In October, Sweden
became the first EU member state to
recognize the State of Palestine (although
three other European states did so before
joining the EU), and the UK’s House of
Commons and France’s National Assembly
286
both passed non-binding votes in favour of
recognition. In December, Jordan submitted
a resolution to the UN Security Council that
proposed setting a timetable for a negotiated
settlement that would require Israel to end
its occupation of Palestinian territories by the
end of 2017.
In April, Palestine ratified the four Geneva
Conventions and an array of international
human rights and other treaties, including
the ICCPR, ICESCR, CEDAW, the Convention
on the Rights of the Child and its Optional
Protocol on the involvement of children in
armed conflict, and the UN Convention
against Torture. On 31 December President
Mahmoud Abbas signed 16 other
international treaties as well as the Rome
Statute recognizing the jurisdiction of the
International Criminal Court in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories including East
Jerusalem from 13 June 2014.
Tensions were heightened by Israel’s
killing of at least 15 Palestinians by the
end of June, the abduction and murder
of three Israeli teenagers by Palestinians
near Hebron and the revenge killing of a
Palestinian youth by Israelis. The tensions
spiralled into renewed armed conflict in July
when Israel launched its Protective Edge
military offensive, comprising aerial attacks
and a ground invasion of Gaza. The offensive
lasted for 50 days before the two sides
agreed a ceasefire facilitated by the US and
Egyptian governments. The offensive caused
the deaths of more than 1,500 civilians in
Gaza, including over 500 children, and the
wounding of thousands more. It wrought
huge devastation, damaging and destroying
schools, hospitals, homes and other civilian
infrastructure. Gaza remained under Israeli
military blockade throughout the year.
ARMED CONFLICT
Hamas and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza
repeatedly fired indiscriminate rockets and
mortars into Israel. Firing greatly intensified in
the period preceding and throughout Israel’s
Protective Edge military offensive in Gaza. By
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the time of the August ceasefire that ended
the conflict, firing of indiscriminate weapons
from Gaza by Palestinian armed groups
had killed six civilians in Israel, including a
child aged four, wounded other civilians and
damaged a number of civilian homes. The
firing also led directly to civilian deaths in
Gaza, due to the premature explosion of some
rockets; the killing of 10 Palestinian civilians
including nine children in the al-Shati’ refugee
camp on 28 July was believed to have been
caused by a rocket that fell short of its target.
Palestinian armed groups also exposed
civilians in Gaza to lethal harm from Israeli
attacks by concealing and firing rockets and
other projectiles from locations within or close
to civilian residential areas. Firing was mostly
halted after the ceasefire agreement.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Security authorities in both the West Bank
and Gaza arbitrarily arrested and detained
their critics and supporters of rival political
organizations.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Detainees were tortured and otherwise
ill-treated with impunity. The Independent
Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), a
national body established to monitor human
rights and receive complaints, said it received
over 120 allegations of torture and other
ill-treatment of detainees from the West Bank
and over 440 allegations from Gaza during
the year. Methods of torture included beatings
and forcing detainees to stand or sit in stress
positions (shabah) for long periods. In the
West Bank, detainees alleged that they were
tortured or otherwise ill-treated by police,
Preventive Security, military intelligence and
General Intelligence officials. In Gaza, at least
three men died in custody allegedly from
torture by Internal Security officials. Both
authorities failed to protect detainees from
torture and other ill-treatment, investigate
allegations or hold those responsible
to account.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
UNFAIR TRIALS
Political and judicial authorities failed to
ensure that detainees received prompt and
fair trials. Authorities in the West Bank held
detainees for indefinite periods without
charge or trial. In Gaza, the Hamas authorities
continued to subject civilians to unfair trials
before military courts.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
Authorities restricted freedoms of expression,
association and assembly in the West Bank
and Gaza. Security forces dispersed protests
organized by opposition activists, frequently
using excessive force. On many occasions,
journalists reporting on protests complained
that security forces assaulted them or
damaged their equipment. Security officials
also harassed and sought to intimidate
journalists and social media activists,
including by repeatedly summoning them for
questioning and sometimes detaining them
for their writings.
In March, police in the Gazan city of
Khan Yunis used force to break up a
commemorative event organized by Fatah
supporters, reportedly firing in the air to
disperse the gathering and arresting and
briefly detaining many participants.
In the West Bank, security forces assaulted
journalists from Palestinian broadcaster
Wattan TV who were present to report on
demonstrations. In one incident in October,
security forces attacked a Wattan TV crew
covering a demonstration in Hebron and
seized their equipment.
EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS
During the Israeli offensive Protective Edge,
members of Hamas’ military Izz ad-Din
al-Qassam Brigades and the Internal Security
Force committed at least 22 summary and
extrajudicial executions of people whom they
accused of “collaboration” with Israel. Those
killed included a number of prisoners who
were appealing against sentences of death
or prison terms passed by military courts in
287Gaza; others were detainees who had faced
no formal charges or trial. On 5 August the de
facto Ministry of Interior removed five inmates
of Katiba Prison who were extrajudicially
executed outside the prison. On 22 August
Hamas forces removed 11 prisoners from
Katiba Prison whose trials or appeals were
pending, and extrajudicially executed them at
the al-Jawazat Police Station. Later the same
morning six men arrested during Operation
Protective Edge were shot dead in public
after Friday prayers. Izz ad-Din al-Qassam
Brigades reportedly shot other suspected
"collaborators" in the street during Operation
Protective Edge. DEATH PENALTY
IMPUNITY Republic of Panama
Head of state and government: Juan Carlos Varela
(replaced Ricardo Martinelli in July)
Palestinian authorities failed to take any
steps to investigate alleged war crimes and
possible crimes against humanity committed
by Hamas’ military wing and other Palestinian
armed groups in the run-up to and during the
conflict in July and August or during previous
conflicts with Israel in which Palestinian
armed groups fired indiscriminate rockets and
mortars into Israel. They also failed to hold to
account officials who committed human rights
violations, including excessive use of force
against peaceful protesters and the torture
of detainees.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
Women and girls continued to face
discrimination in both law and practice, and
remained inadequately protected against
gender-based violence committed by male
relatives, ostensibly for reasons of family
“honour”. At least 11 women and girls were
murdered by male relatives in so-called
“honour killings” during the year, according
to reports of the ICHR. They included Islam
Mohammad Al-Shami, 18, who died after
she was stabbed in the neck on 20 October
while praying inside her family home at Bani
Suheila, Khan Yunis governorate.
The death penalty remained in force for
murder and other crimes. There were no
executions reported in the West Bank, but
in Gaza, Hamas military and first instance
courts sentenced at least eight people to
death on murder charges. In May, Gaza
authorities executed two men, both of whom
had been sentenced to death on treason and
murder charges.
PANAMA
Former President Manuel Noriega faced new
trials relating to human rights violations
during his presidency and the killing of
a soldier in 1969. A Special National
Commission on victims of enforced
disappearance had yet to be established.
The rights of Indigenous Peoples were
threatened by hydroelectricity projects.
Local NGOs were prevented by the
authorities from following up complaints of
harsh prison conditions.
BACKGROUND
In July, Juan Carlos Varela was sworn in
as President. In August, the UN Working
Group of Experts on People of African
Descent noted that, despite the adoption of
anti-discrimination legislation, patterns of
racial discrimination prevailed and persons
of African descent – around 10% of the
population – continued to suffer from political,
social and economic marginalization.
IMPUNITY
In September the Supreme Court of Justice
decided that Manuel Noriega, former de
facto ruler of the country from 1983 to 1989,
288
Amnesty International Report 2014/15should face trial for his alleged role in the
killing of a soldier in 1969. The decision
came as Manuel Noriega was serving
sentences related to the killing of two political
opponents. He also faced new trials for
enforced disappearances and killings during
his presidency.
Despite previous pledges to search for
people forcibly disappeared during the
1970s and 1980s, the government failed
to make any progress. A Special National
Commission to search for victims of enforced
disappearance, which the government
pledged to create in 2012, had still not been
established by the end of the year.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
There were protests in February, April and
May in the area of Barro Blanco, resulting in
clashes between members of the Ngöbe-
Buglé Indigenous community and the police.
The Ngöbe-Buglé opposed the construction
of a large hydroelectric dam on their lands,
claiming that future flooding resulting from
it would render them homeless. They also
alleged that their right to be consulted over
the project prior to construction commencing
was not met.
In May the UN Special Rapporteur on
the rights of indigenous peoples noted that
although the comarca system of Indigenous
Peoples’ administrative zones offered some
protection, more needed to be done to protect
Indigenous Peoples’ land rights. The Special
Rapporteur recommended that Panama
ensure consultation of Indigenous Peoples
and their free and informed consent, prior
to proposing large construction projects on
or near their lands. He also recommended
that Panama increase its efforts to improve
Indigenous Peoples’ access to health,
education and economic development.
With regard to the Barro Blanco dam, he
recommended that flooding of the local areas
be halted until agreement with the Ngöbe-
Buglé community had been reached.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
PRISON CONDITIONS
In April, local human rights NGOs wrote
to the UN Subcommittee on Prevention
of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and
the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights, raising concerns that they were
being prevented by the authorities from
accessing prisons, which was impeding their
work in following up complaints of inhuman
conditions in prisons.
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
Independent State of Papua New Guinea
Head of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by
Governor General Michael Ogio
Head of government: Peter Charles Paire O’Neill
There were further reports of violence
against women and children, including as
a result of sorcery accusations. Reports
of unnecessary and excessive use of force
by police persisted. There were reports of
violence and sexual assault by police during
a forced eviction near Porgera mine.
Violence and alleged inadequate medical
treatment resulted in the deaths of
two asylum-seekers at the Australian-
run immigration detention centre on
Manus Island.
BACKGROUND
The government took little action to address
violence against women or sorcery-related
violence, in spite of legal reforms in 2013
providing for harsher penalties.
As at 31 August there were 1,084 asylum-
seekers at the Australian-run immigration
detention centre on Manus Island, Papua
New Guinea. Little progress had been made
to improve conditions or to implement laws
and policies required to process and settle
asylum-seekers. 1
289According to government figures, at least
13 people have been sentenced to death
since the death penalty was reintroduced in
1991. The government completed a global
study tour in 2014 to research execution
methods, even though none have taken place
in the country since 1954.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
AND CHILDREN
A 2013 report by the UN Development
Programme found that 80% of men in
Bougainville admitted using physical or sexual
violence against women.
There were further reports of women
and children being subjected to violence,
sometimes resulting in death, following
accusations of sorcery. The UN Special
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or
arbitrary executions highlighted sorcery-
related killings as a major concern. He was
the third Special Rapporteur to report on this
issue in recent years.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Unnecessary and excessive use of force,
including lethal force, by police was
highlighted as one of the key concerns by
the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,
summary or arbitrary executions following
his visit to the country in March. Reports
of physical and sexual assault of people
in custody and extrajudicial killings by
police continued.
In March a video surfaced of a man being
attacked in the street by three police dogs.
Police officers stood by and made no attempt
to arrest or detain the man. While police
authorities have attempted to investigate and
address complaints against officers, reports of
police brutality remained frequent.
received of physical and sexual violence by
police during the forced eviction.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In February, violence erupted at the
Australian-run immigration detention centre
on Manus Island. After weeks of protests,
asylum-seekers were attacked by private
security guards and local police. In August,
police charged two former employees of the
Salvation Army and security contractor G4S in
connection with the death of Iranian asylum-
seeker Reza Berati, who died from severe
head trauma during a riot at the detention
centre on 17 February. 2 In September,
human rights organizations lodged a
complaint with the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development against G4S,
alleging that it had failed to maintain basic
human rights standards and protect asylum-
seekers.
In September another Iranian asylum-
seeker from Manus Island, Hamid Kehazaei,
died in hospital in Australia after developing
septicaemia from a cut on his foot. Reports
claimed that inadequate or delayed medical
treatment had led to his death.
Of the 1,084 asylum-seekers on Manus
Island, a total of 79 applications for interim
refugee status were processed, of which
41 were successful and 38 were rejected.
Refugees and asylum-seekers remained
detained at the facility at the end of the year.
Asylum-seekers continued to suffer lengthy
delays, poor conditions and risk of harm.

Republic of Paraguay
Head of state and government: Horacio Manuel
Cartes Jara
Despite some advances, Indigenous Peoples
continued to be denied access to their
traditional lands. Impunity for human rights
violations persisted. Abortion continued to
be criminalized in most cases.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
Progress was made in resolving the land
claims of some Indigenous communities,
but others continued to be denied their
traditional lands.
In June, an expropriation law was passed
to return to the Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous
community their traditional land. The
community had lived in harsh conditions
by the side of a busy road for more than 20
years. 1 In September a constitutional action to
revoke the expropriation law was rejected by
the Supreme Court.
By the end of the year the Yakye Axa
community was still unable to resettle on their
land – despite an agreement between the
authorities and the landowner having been
finalized in January 2012 – because road
access to the land was not ready.
In May police officers raided the Y’apo Ava
Guaraní community in Canindeyú department
following a judicial eviction order. The
community fled before the raid. There were
reports of destruction of houses and sacred
temples. In June, the community reported
that private security guards further attempted
to forcibly evict them; many members of the
community were injured and one person
carrying out the eviction died. Investigations
into the event were ongoing at the end of
the year. The community claimed that the
area was part of their ancestral land. In
2001 a judicial decision had confirmed the
possession of the land by the community;
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
however, in April 2014 a judicial action was
filed by a company claiming ownership of the
land. A judicial decision was still pending at
the end of the year.
IMPUNITY
Judicial proceedings continued against 12
campesinos (peasant farmers) at the end of
the year for their alleged involvement in the
killings of six police officers and other related
crimes in the context of a 2012 land dispute
in Curuguaty district. Eleven peasant farmers
also died during the clashes; however, nobody
has been charged for their deaths, raising
concerns that the investigation was not
impartial. 2
In April the Aché National Federation
filed in Argentina an additional criminal
complaint to the one already presented in
2013 by victims of human rights violations
committed during the regime of General
Alfredo Stroessner (1954-1989), in view of
the persistent reluctance of the Paraguayan
authorities to investigate those crimes.
The criminal complaint was subject to an
investigation under universal jurisdiction.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The newly established National Preventive
Mechanism against Torture issued its first
annual report in April. The report found that
the lack of sanctions and investigations into
allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
was one of the main causes of torture in the
country. The Mechanism was also seriously
concerned about poor prison conditions,
including overcrowding.
Investigations into allegations of torture
of campesinos during the 2012 clashes in
Curuguaty district were ongoing at the end of
the year.
Four prison officials were under
investigation in relation to the deaths of
two adolescents and the injury of at least
three other youths during riots in April and
August at Itauguá Educational Centre juvenile
detention facility.
291WOMEN’S AND GIRLS’ RIGHTS
A law submitted to Congress in 2012 to
prevent, punish and eradicate sexual and
gender violence was still pending.
In August the Senate passed legislation to
reform an article in the Criminal Code which
only sanctions domestic violence if the assault
happens regularly. The reform proposes to
sanction the crime even if committed only
once. The reform also increases the penalties
under this article and was pending final
approval by the Deputy Chamber at the end
of the year.
In August, Lucía Sandoval was acquitted
of killing her husband in 2011 in the context
of domestic violence. She spent three years
in detention pending trial. The court found
that there was insufficient evidence to prove
her involvement in the killing and released
her. The case raised concerns about the lack
of appropriate measures to protect women
survivors of domestic violence in Paraguay.
An appeal against the decision was pending
at the end of the year.
Abortion remained criminalized in most
circumstances, including in cases where
the pregnancy was the result of rape or
incest or where the foetus would be unable
to survive outside the womb. Abortion was
only permitted when the life or health of the
woman or girl was at risk.
DISCRIMINATION
In November, the Senate rejected legislation
to prevent and combat discrimination on
all grounds.
ARMS TRADE
Legislation to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty
was passed.

PERU
Republic of Peru
Head of state and government: Ollanta Moisés
Humala Tasso
Activists and government critics were
attacked. Use of excessive force by
security forces was reported. The rights
of Indigenous Peoples to adequate
consultation, and free, prior and informed
consent were not fulfilled. Sexual and
reproductive rights were not guaranteed.
Impunity remained a concern.
BACKGROUND
Social conflict and protests in communities
affected by extractive industries continued to
be widespread. Some protests led to clashes
with security forces.
At least four members of the security forces
were killed and seven were injured in clashes
with remnants of the armed opposition group,
Shining Path.
A national mechanism for the prevention of
torture and other ill-treatment was approved
by the Congress in June. At the end of the
year, it had not been implemented as the
President had not ratified it.
Serious concerns were raised over the
conditions in which over 100 prisoners were
kept in Challapalca Prison situated over
4,600m above sea level in the Tacna region.
The prison’s inaccessibility to relatives,
doctors and lawyers limits the prisoners’ right
to visits and constituted cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment.
In July, the second two-year National Plan
for Human Rights was approved by Congress,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15amidst concerns that LGBTI rights were
explicitly excluded, and that the Plan had not
been fully resourced for its implementation.
A law which would grant equal rights to
same-sex couples had not been discussed in
Congress at the end of the year.
REPRESSION OF DISSENT
Activists and government critics, including
human rights defenders, continued to be
attacked, in particular those defending
the rights of communities affected by
extractive industries.
Security forces and private security
personnel of the Yanacocha gold mining
company intimidated and attacked Máxima
Chaupe, her family and others from
Indigenous and peasant communities
in Cajamarca, Celendín and Hualgayoc-
Bambamarca provinces, Cajamarca region.
They opposed the mining on their lands
claiming that they had not been consulted
and that their right to water and means of
subsistence were under attack. In May, the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
requested precautionary measures on their
behalf. At the end of the year, no protection
had been granted.
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS
In September, Indigenous leaders Edwin
Chota Valera, Jorge Ríos Pérez, Leoncio
Quinticima Meléndez and Francisco Pinedo
from the Asháninka Indigenous community
of Alto Tamaya-Saweto, Ucayali region,
were killed by suspected illegal loggers, in
retaliation for their activism against illegal
logging on their ancestral lands. Prior to the
attack, the community had raised concerns
about their safety and the authorities had
failed to protect them. At the end of the year,
an investigation had been opened. However,
there were still concerns about the safety of
the families of those killed.
In spite of some efforts to implement the
2011 law that guarantees the right to free,
prior and informed consent of Indigenous
Peoples, there were concerns over the lack
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
of a clear methodology and consistency in its
implementation prior to granting extractive
industries’ concessions. In January, the
authorities granted a concession to expand
the Camisea gas extraction project in the
Cusco region, amid concerns that none of
the Indigenous communities that could be
affected had given their consent and that
nearly a quarter of the territory could be
occupied by Indigenous Peoples living in
voluntary isolation.
In May, the trial of 53 people started,
including Indigenous people and some
of their leaders. They had been accused
of the death of 12 police officers during a
police and military operation to disperse a
road blockade led by Indigenous people in
Bagua, Amazon region, in 2009. A total of 33
people died, including 23 police officers, and
over 200 people were injured. No police or
military officers have been held accountable
for the human rights violations committed
against civilians.
IMPUNITY
Excessive use of force
At least nine people were killed and scores
were injured amid concerns that the security
forces had used excessive force during
protests throughout the year. At the end of the
year, no investigation was known to have been
initiated into the deaths.
There were concerns that a new law
passed in January could perpetuate impunity.
The law exempted security forces of penal
responsibility when killing or injuring people
while on duty. In February, four police
officers, who were being tried for their
responsibility in the deaths of three protesters
in Huancavelica in 2011, were acquitted
when the judge applied the law retroactively.
There were allegations of excessive use of
force when scores of protesters were injured
during the demonstrations.
Internal armed conflict
Eleven years after the publication of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s
report, progress to guarantee truth, justice
293and reparation to all the victims remained
slow. There were concerns that the armed
forces continued to fail to co-operate with
the judiciary and that some cases were
closed as the judges ruled that the crimes
had prescribed.
PHILIPPINES
Republic of the Philippines
Head of state and government: Benigno S. Aquino

SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
In January, the Public Prosecutor’s Office in
Lima, the capital, closed the cases of over
2,000 Indigenous and campesino women
who were allegedly forcibly sterilized in the
1990s. After an investigation, which started
in 2004 and lasted nearly 10 years, the
Prosecutor only filed charges against some
health professionals allegedly responsible
in one of the cases. No charges were filed
against any of the government authorities
responsible for implementing the family
planning programme, which resulted in these
sterilizations.
In June, the Ministry of Health adopted
technical guidelines for therapeutic abortion.
There were concerns that the restrictive
interpretation of therapeutic abortion in the
protocol may lead women to seek unsafe and
illegal terminations because the two access
conditions required – presence and signature
of a witness and approval of a board – were
considered obstructive.
Abortion in cases of pregnancy resulting
from rape or incest remained criminalized
and the free distribution of emergency
contraceptives, including in cases of sexual
abuse, continued to be banned. At the end
of the year, a draft law to legalize abortion for
victims of rape, backed by 60,000 signatures,
was waiting to be discussed in Congress.
294
Torture continued with impunity in the
Philippines. Human rights defenders,
local journalists and witnesses in the
Maguindanao massacre trials, the world’s
largest single attack on journalists
committed in 2009, remained at risk
of unlawful killing. The Philippines
acknowledged state accountability
for human rights violations during the
Martial Law under the Marcos regime and
established a Human Rights Victims’ Claims
Board to determine the eligibility of claims
for human rights violations and award
reparations. The Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of the Reproductive Health
Law in April.
BACKGROUND
The Philippine government in March signed
a comprehensive peace agreement with the
armed group Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
concluding 17 years of peace negotiations.
The peace accord created the autonomous
Bangsamoro region, providing greater
political autonomy in southern Philippines
in exchange for a commitment to end the
insurgency and calls for a separate state.
The Philippines continued its claim over
the Spratly Islands against Brunei, China,
Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, submitting
a memorandum before the International
Tribunal on the Law of the Seas in March
and protesting against China’s actions in the
Spratlys in May and November.
A visit by US President Barack Obama
in April culminated in the signing of an
Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement,
further allowing US military troops to use
Philippine military bases.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In early December, half a million people
were evacuated in advance of Typhoon
Hagupit and 27 casualties were reported.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
rife and appeared to be routine during
interrogations in some police stations. 1
Torture methods included severe beating as
well as electric shocks, mock executions,
waterboarding, near-asphyxiation with plastic
bags, and rape.
Among those most at risk were criminal
suspects and repeat offenders, including
juvenile offenders, informal police auxiliaries
(known locally as “assets”), suspected
members or sympathizers of armed
groups and political activists. Most torture
victims were from poor and marginalized
backgrounds. In 2014, the Commission
on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR)
reported that it recorded 75 cases of torture
in 2013, and 28 cases from January to July
2014. The majority of reports of torture cited
police officers as the alleged perpetrators.
Despite its criminalization under the 2009
Anti-Torture Act, not one perpetrator has been
convicted under the Act.
In January the CHR exposed a secret
detention facility in Laguna province, in which
police officers appeared to be torturing for
entertainment by using a “roulette wheel”
on which torture methods were described.
Forty-three detainees were found inside the
facility. In February the Philippine National
Police (PNP) suspended 10 police officers.
Investigations continued, but none were
convicted at the end of the year. Twenty-three
cases were filed for preliminary investigation
and were pending resolution.
Alfreda Disbarro, a former police informant,
was apprehended and tortured by police
officers in October 2013. In April, the
PNP Internal Affairs Service conducted an
investigation into her case; the decision
on the administrative case against the
perpetrators was pending. The CHR
concluded that human rights violations were
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
committed and in July recommended the
filing of a criminal complaint.
The Senate opened an enquiry into police
torture the day after Amnesty International
launched its report “Above the Law: Police
torture in the Philippines” on 4 December.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Concerns remained over the government’s
commitment to ending enforced
disappearances following its failure to ratify
the International Convention for the Protection
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
In February, the CHR announced that
it would enter into a Memorandum of
Agreement with the Department of Interior
and Local Government, the Department
of National Defense and the Department
of Justice on the implementation of the
Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance
Act of 2012 which criminalized enforced
disappearances. In August, the National
Bureau of Investigation arrested retired
General Jovito Palparan in Manila after three
years in hiding. In 2011, he was charged with
kidnapping, abduction and “serious illegal
detention” of two women university students.
In February the Supreme Court upheld
the finality of the Court of Appeals ruling
identifying a military officer responsible for
the abduction and disappearance of Jonas
Burgos in 2007, and finding the military
accountable for his abduction.
IMPUNITY
Trials in the civil and criminal cases relating
to the 2009 Maguindanao massacre, in
which state-armed militias led by government
officials killed 58 people including 32 media
workers, were ongoing. However, most of
the proceedings were bail hearings only. By
the end of the year, around 85 of the 197
suspects for whom arrest warrants had been
issued remained at large and no convictions
had been handed down.
Witnesses to the massacre and their
families remained at risk of attacks, including
killings, highlighting a lack of government
295protection. In November, Dennis Sakal and
Butch Saudagal, both of whom were due
to testify against primary suspects in the
massacre, were shot by unidentified gunmen
in Maguindanao province, killing Dennis
Sakal. In December, Kagui Akmad Ampatuan,
who reportedly convinced these witnesses to
testify for the prosecution, survived a similar
ambush in Maguindanao.
At least eight witnesses and their family
members had been killed in similar attacks
since November 2009. No one was held
accountable for these killings.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
At least three radio broadcasters and
one newspaper reporter were killed by
unidentified gunmen in 2014.
In February, the Supreme Court declared
major provisions of the 2012 Cybercrime
Prevention Act, including the online libel
provision, as constitutional. The Court clarified
that only original authors of libellous material
were covered by the law, excluding those who
reacted online to the libellous post.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Attacks by hardline Islamist insurgents
opposed to the peace accord between
the government and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front continued. In July, an
attack by Abu Sayyaf in Sulu province left
21 people dead. In December, 10 people
were killed and more than 30 injured when
a mortar bomb exploded on a public bus in
Bukidnon province.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Following a year-long suspension of its
implementation, in April the Supreme
Court upheld the Reproductive Health Law
following a legal challenge by various faith-
based groups. The law paves the way for
government funding for modern contraceptive
methods and seeks to introduce reproductive
health and sexuality education in schools.
However, the Court’s ruling found eight
provisions to be unconstitutional. These
296
included: prohibiting health practitioners
from refusing to provide reproductive health
services and penalizing them if they did;
requiring all private health facilities, including
those owned by religious groups, to provide
family planning methods, including modern
contraceptive supplies and procedures;
allowing minors – including those who already
have children or have had miscarriages –
access to birth control without their parents’
written consent; and allowing married
individuals to undergo reproductive health
procedures without their spouse’s consent.
The Department of Justice failed to include
exceptions to the total ban on abortion in
the draft criminal code it sent to Congress.
Due to the total ban on abortion, clandestine
abortions remained widespread, resulting in
unnecessary death and disability of women.

POLAND
Republic of Poland
Head of state: Bronislaw Komorowski
Head of government: Ewa Kopacz (replaced Donald
Tusk in September)
Former Polish president has admitted
that Poland hosted a secret CIA prison.
The European Court of Human Rights
ruled against Poland for complicity in CIA
secret detention and torture. Concerns over
protection and fulfilment of sexual and
reproductive rights persisted. Poland has not
ratified the Council of Europe Convention on
preventing and combating violence against
women and domestic violence.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
Poland became the first EU member state
to be found complicit in the USA’s rendition
and secret detention programmes, authorized
by US President George W. Bush in the
aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks
in the USA. In July, the European Court
of Human Rights ruled in two separate
judgments that the Polish government
colluded with the US Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) to establish a secret prison at
Stare Kiejkuty, where detainees were held in
secret, subjected to enforced disappearance,
and tortured. The two claimants, Abd
al-Rahim al-Nashiri and Zayn al-Abidin
Muhammad Husayn (Abu Zubaydah),
applied to the European Court in 2011 and
2013, respectively. Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri,
a Saudi Arabian national alleged to have
masterminded the bombing of the USS Cole
off the coast of Yemen in 2000, has claimed
that he was questioned in a secret facility
in Poland and subjected to “enhanced
interrogation techniques” and other human
rights violations, such as “mock execution”
with a gun and threats of sexual assault
against his family. Abu Zubaydah, a stateless
Palestinian born in Saudi Arabia, also alleged
that he was held in Poland, where he said
he was subjected to extreme physical pain
and psychological suffering, including
“waterboarding”. Abd al-Rahim Al-Nashiri
faced a capital trial by military commission in
Guantánamo Bay.
The European Court found Poland in
violation of the European Convention on
Human Rights for, among other things,
the lack of an investigation into the men’s
claims, their torture and other ill-treatment,
secret detention, and transfer to other places
where they were at risk of further human
rights violations. The Court also reaffirmed
the victims’ and the public’s right to truth. In
October, the government referred the cases
to the Grand Chamber of the European Court
for a review de novo. At the end of the year,
the Chamber had not made a decision on the
government’s request.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
A third man who had alleged that he was
held at a secret detention site in 2003 was
granted “injured person” status in October
2013 in Poland’s national investigation into
the CIA site. Walid bin Attash, a Yemeni
national, is currently detained and awaiting
trial by military commission at Guantánamo
Bay. A fourth man, Mustafa al-Hawsawi,
lodged an application with the prosecutors
seeking injured person status in the ongoing
investigation into allegations of the rendition
and secret detention programmes. At the end
of the year, the prosecutor was considering
whether to reverse a prior negative decision
on Mustafa al-Hawsawi’s application.
After years of denials, former Polish
president Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted
in December that Poland had hosted
a secret CIA prison where detainees
were held between 2002 and 2003. The
acknowledgment came in the aftermath of
the release of a heavily redacted summary
of a US Senate report on the CIA's secret
detention programme. Although Poland was
not named, the facts surrounding what was
called “detention site blue” in the Senate
report conformed to the dates of detention
and accounts of torture described by Abu
Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in
their European Court applications.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Despite the judgment of the European Court
of Human Rights in October 2012 in the case
of P. and S. v. Poland, in which Poland was
found to have violated the right to private life
and to be free from inhuman and degrading
treatment when a 14-year-old girl’s right to a
lawful abortion was denied, there has been
little progress in ensuring access to legal
abortion. The authorities failed to introduce
measures to ensure effective implementation
of the abortion law and to guarantee that the
conscientious objection of health workers did
not inhibit women’s access to lawful services.
In June, a woman was denied access to
an abortion despite prenatal tests indicating
severe and irreversible damage of the fetus.
297Although the law allows abortion in such
cases, the Director of a public hospital in
Warsaw refused to allow the abortion to be
performed in the hospital, citing grounds
of conscience, despite the fact that the
conscientious objection exemption extends
to individuals not institutions. The child died
10 days after the birth. In July, the Ministry
of Health fined the hospital for violating the
patient’s rights and the Mayor of Warsaw
dismissed the Director from his post. In
response to the case, the Commissioner
for Patients’ Rights recommended that
the government amend the regulations on
conscientious objection. period of detention for asylum-seekers to
24 months. According to the Polish NGOs
Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights and
the Association for Legal Intervention, nearly
one in four people held in migration detention
were children.
In October, the European Court of Human
Rights asked the government to clarify the
circumstances of the administrative detention
of an ethnic Chechen asylum-seeker and her
five children. The woman and children were
deported to Chechnya in March, even though
their asylum procedure was still pending.
DISCRIMINATION PORTUGAL
In March, the UN Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted
an increase in hate crimes, including anti-
Semitic attacks. It criticized the lack of a
provision in the Criminal Code establishing
racial motivation as an aggravating
circumstance of a crime.
Anti-discrimination legislation failed
to provide equal protection against
discrimination in all areas on all grounds.
Discrimination was not explicitly prohibited on
the grounds of sexual identity, and was only
prohibited in respect of sexual orientation in
the sphere of employment.
Portuguese Republic
Head of state: Aníbal António Cavaco Silva
Head of government: Pedro Manuel Mamede
Passos Coelho
Reports of excessive use of force by police
and inadequate prison conditions continued.
Roma continued to face discrimination.
Austerity measures affected the enjoyment
of economic and social rights and in some
instances were found unconstitutional.
JUSTICE SYSTEM BACKGROUND
In January, the Act on Proceedings against
Persons with Mental Disorders came into
force. The new law allowed courts to impose
preventive measures against convicted
persons with mental disorders who threaten
the life, health and sexual freedom of
others. Possible measures included isolation
in closed mental health units following a
completed jail sentence. The President
referred the law to the Constitutional Tribunal
for review. In May, the report of the Working Group
on the UN Universal Periodic Review of
Portugal highlighted the need for Portugal
to protect the human rights of vulnerable
groups from the negative impact of austerity
measures adopted in 2013. Also in May,
the Constitutional Court declared several
austerity measures unconstitutional due to
their disproportionate impact on economic
and social rights. The measures adopted in
2013 were related to public servants' salaries,
pensions and sickness and unemployment
benefits. In the case of salaries, there was
no retroactive reparation for the negative
effects already created by such measures.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS' RIGHTS
The new Law on Foreigners, which entered
into force in May, extended the maximum
298
Amnesty International Report 2014/15At the end of the year the government was
planning to reintroduce similar measures in
the new budget.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In July 2014, two prison officers were handed
an eight-month suspended sentence by the
court of Paços de Ferreira for using excessive
force against a detainee in the Paços de
Ferreira prison in 2010. The two officers had
entered the prisoner‘s cell to force him to
either clean it or leave in order for the cell
to be cleaned. Even though the detainee
obeyed orders to stand up, turn his back
to the cell door and face the window, the
officers used a Taser to immobilize him. The
court considered that the Taser was used
disproportionately, particularly as the man
had not resorted to any violence against the
prison officers.
Prison conditions
In December 2013, the UN Committee
against Torture highlighted reports of ill-
treatment and excessive use of force, as well
as prison overcrowding and deplorable prison
conditions, particularly in the Prison of Santa
Cruz do Bispo and the Lisbon Central Prison.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Forced evictions of Roma families continued
to be reported.
In June, the homes of 67 members of
the Vidigueira Roma Community, including
35 children and three pregnant women,
were demolished by the municipality in
their absence. According to reports, the
eviction was implemented without prior
notice and the families had no opportunity
to collect their belongings before their
homes were demolished. The families were
made homeless as a result of the eviction.
In September, a class consisting exclusively
of Roma children, aged seven to 14, was
created in a school in Tomar. No action was
taken by relevant authorities to address the
segregation of Roma children.

New asylum legislation adopted in January
extended the criteria for detaining persons
seeking international protection. Overcrowding
remained in the Reception Centre for
Refugees of the Portuguese Refugee Council
in Lisbon, which accommodated asylum-
seekers awaiting a decision on their status.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
According to data provided by the NGO
UMAR (União de Mulheres Alternativa e
Resposta), as of 30 November, 40 women
were killed by partners, ex-partners and
close family members. There were also
46 attempted murders. The number had
risen since 2013, when 37 homicides were
registered for the whole year.
PUERTO RICO
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
Head of state: Barack Obama
Head of government: Alejandro García Padilla
The US Department of Justice continued
to pursue death sentences on federal
charges. Despite some advances in law,
LGBTI people continued to be denied their
right to non-discrimination. Laws restricting
the rights to freedom of assembly and
expression were repealed.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In October 2014, a US federal district judge in
San Juan upheld Puerto Rico’s ban on same-
sex marriage. The judge stated: “Because no
299right to same-gender marriage emanates from
the Constitution, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico should not be compelled to recognize
such unions.” An appeal was pending before
the US Federal Appeals Court at the end of
the year.
In February 2013, the Supreme Court
affirmed the ban on same-sex adoption. In a
5-4 vote, judges upheld the constitutionality
of a law that states that a person cannot
adopt a single-parent child if the would-be
adopter is of the same sex as the child's
mother or father without that parent losing
their legal rights.
In 2013 there were advances in the
creation of laws to protect the rights of
LGBTI people, including a bill that prohibits
employment discrimination based on gender
identity or sexual orientation and a bill to
extend domestic violence protections to
same-sex couples. However, a proposed
amendment to the Penal Code, which would
have criminalized discrimination against
LGBTI people, was removed. The revised
Penal Code was before Governor Padilla
awaiting endorsement at the end of the year. Rico reached an agreement to reform the
country’s police force after a 2011 federal
report found unconstitutional conduct by
the police, including unlawful killings. Under
the federally mandated reform programme,
Puerto Rico has 10 years to carry out
the reforms.

DEATH PENALTY
As a commonwealth of the USA, Puerto Rico
is subject to some US federal laws. Although
the death penalty on the island was abolished
in 1929, the US Department of Justice has
attempted over the years to obtain a death
sentence on federal charges in a number of
cases. During 2013, Puerto Rico juries voted
for life imprisonment in three cases in which
the US administration had been pursuing the
death penalty. By the end of 2014, there were
no authorized federal capital prosecutions
pending trial in Puerto Rico.
QATAR
Migrant workers remained inadequately
protected under the law and were exploited
and abused. Women faced discrimination
and violence. The authorities restricted
freedom of expression and courts failed
to uphold fair trial standards. At least two
death sentences were passed; no executions
were reported.
BACKGROUND
Elections for the advisory Shura Council,
originally planned for 2013, did not take
place. The term of the Shura Council had
been extended until 2016 by the former
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Emir prior to his abdication as head of state
in 2013.
A rift between Qatar and other Gulf
Cooperation Council states, reportedly over
Qatar’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood,
among other things, saw Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates
withdraw their ambassadors from Qatar in
March. In November, it was announced that
they would be reinstated. In September, Qatar
asked seven prominent Egyptian members of
the Muslim Brotherhood to leave Qatar.
The government faced growing
international pressure to address abuses of
the rights of migrant workers. FIFA, football’s
world governing body, discussed the issue of
migrant labour abuse at its March Executive
Committee meeting, intensifying pressure
on the authorities to address the abuse of
workers ahead of the 2022 football World Cup
in Qatar.
The UN Human Rights Council expressed
concern about abuses of the rights of
migrants, discrimination and violence against
women, and restrictions on freedoms of
expression and assembly during its Universal
Periodic Review of Qatar in May.
MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
Employers continued to abuse and exploit
foreign migrant workers, who comprised more
than 90% of Qatar’s total workforce. The
authorities failed to adequately enforce the
2004 Labour Law and related decrees, which
contained some protective provisions.
Workers’ living conditions were often
grossly inadequate and many workers
said they were made to work excessive
hours beyond the legal maximum or were
paid far less than agreed when they were
contracted. Some employers failed to pay
workers their wages, and some did not issue
residency permits to employees, leaving
them undocumented and at risk of arrest
and detention. Few workers possessed their
own passports and some employers denied
workers the exit permits they required to leave
Qatar. Construction workers were exposed to
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
hazardous conditions. Under the Labour Law,
migrant workers were prohibited from forming
or joining trade unions.
The government announced that it had
increased the number of labour inspectors;
that it was subjecting more companies to
punitive sanctions; and that it had planned
measures to improve conditions for migrant
workers, including new accommodation
standards and an electronic wage protection
system. However, these measures had not
been made law by the end of the year.
Migrant domestic workers, mostly women,
and certain other workers were specifically
excluded from the Labour Law, exposing
them to greater labour exploitation and abuse,
including sexual abuse. 1 The government
repeatedly stated its commitment to enact
legislation to address this problem but it
had not done so by the end of the year.
Women domestic workers were liable to face
prosecution and imprisonment for “illicit
relations” if they reported sexual abuse
by employers.
The 2009 Sponsorship Law, which
requires foreign workers to obtain a sponsor’s
permission to leave Qatar or change employer,
continued to be exploited by employers to
prevent workers from complaining to the
authorities or moving to a new job in the event
of abuse. The sponsorship system increased
the likelihood of workers being subjected
to forced labour and human trafficking. In
May, the government announced proposed
reforms to the sponsorship system to amend
the procedure for workers to leave Qatar and
allow workers to change employers after the
completion of their contract or after five years
with the same employer. At the end of the
year, no legislation had been passed and no
drafts had been published. 2 In April the UN
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of
migrants urged the government to abolish the
sponsorship system.
An international law firm commissioned
by the government to review migrant labour
in Qatar submitted its report in April. The
authorities did not publish the report,
301although a leaked version containing more
than 60 recommendations appeared on the
internet. The government did not say whether
it would implement the recommendations.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women remained unable to fully exercise
their human rights due to barriers in law,
policy and practice. The absence of a
law specifically criminalizing domestic
violence exposed women to abuse within
the family, while personal status laws
discriminated against women in relation to
marriage, divorce, nationality and freedom
of movement.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Freedom of expression remained strictly
controlled and the press routinely exercised
self-censorship.
The poet Mohammed al-Ajami, also known
as Mohammed Ibn al-Dheeb, remained in
prison in solitary confinement after Qatar’s
highest court upheld his 15-year sentence on
20 October 2013. He had been convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment in November
2012 for writing and reciting poems deemed
offensive to the state and the Emir, but his
sentence was reduced on appeal. He was
detained incommunicado for three months
after his arrest and tried in secret. He was in
solitary confinement throughout most of his
imprisonment.
A new cybercrimes law was enacted
in September. The law criminalized the
dissemination of “false” news and the
publication online of content deemed harmful
to Qatar’s “social values” or national interests.
The law’s vaguely worded provisions risked
increasing self-censorship among journalists
and further stifling online criticism of the
authorities.
enforced disappearance for one week, before
officials acknowledged their detention and

They were held incommunicado and released

not able to leave Qatar until 19 September. 3
JUSTICE SYSTEM
Following her visit to Qatar in January, the
UN Special Rapporteur on the independence
of judges and lawyers expressed concern
at, among other things, the government’s
“interference” in judicial procedures,
particularly in cases involving high-profile
individuals or businesses, as well as violations
of due process and the failure of the judiciary
to meet international fair trial standards.
On 30 April, Doha Criminal Court convicted
three Filipino nationals of espionage; one
was sentenced to death, the other two to life
imprisonment. The convictions were based
largely on confessions reportedly extracted
under torture. All three men lodged appeals.
DEATH PENALTY
At least two people were sentenced to death.
No executions were reported.

Romania
Head of state: Klaus Iohannis (replaced Traian

Head of government: Victor Ponta
A former senior intelligence official
confirmed that Romania had co-operated
with the CIA to establish a secret prison
in the country. Roma continued to
experience discrimination, forced evictions
and other human rights violations. The
parliamentary Commission for the Revision
of the Constitution passed an amendment
restricting protection against discrimination.
BACKGROUND
In January, the European Commission
expressed concerns about the independence
of the judicial system. International and
Romanian NGOs expressed concerns over
the failure of the authorities to seriously
engage with the review process by the UN
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights. In December, the Committee criticized
the failure of the government to ensure the
effective protection of a wide range of human
rights enshrined in the ICESCR, including
the right to adequate housing, water and
sanitation, and sexual and reproductive rights,
in the Committee’s first review of the country
for over 20 years.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Roma continued to face systemic
discrimination. Public officials used
discriminatory and stigmatizing speech
against Roma. In February, President
Traian Băsescu was fined for the second
time by the National Council for Combating
Discrimination. During an official visit to
Slovenia in November 2010, he stated that
“among nomad Roma, very few want to work
and many of them, traditionally, live off what
they steal.” In July, the Cluj-Napoca Court
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
of Appeal found that the government had
failed to implement measures promised in the
wake of attacks against Roma communities in
Hădăreni, including community development
projects to improve living conditions and inter-
ethnic relations. The Hădăreni events were
among some 30 incidents of mob violence
directed at Romani communities throughout
Romania in the early 1990s.
In September 2013, the High Court
of Cassation and Justice upheld the
2011 decision of the National Council for
Combating Discrimination that the concrete
wall erected in Baia Mare to separate
blocks of houses inhabited by Roma from
the rest of the residential area amounted to
discrimination.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
The concluding observations of the UN
Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights called on the government
to ensure access to adequate housing for
disadvantaged and marginalized groups,
including Roma, and to amend the legislation
to prohibit forced evictions. 1
Local authorities continued to forcibly evict
Romani communities. Some were relocated
to inadequate and segregated housing, while
others were effectively made homeless.
Romani families living for over 40 years
in an informal settlement in Eforie Sud,
Constanţa county, were repeatedly forcibly
evicted from their homes. In September 2013,
101 people, including 55 children, were
made homeless in severe weather conditions
when their homes were demolished following
a municipal order. Some of the families were
subsequently offered temporary shelter in
two abandoned school buildings in highly
inadequate living conditions. 2 In July 2014,
seven of the 10 families living in one of the
former schools were relocated to segregated
and inadequate containers on the outskirts
of Eforie Sud, while the remaining three were
left homeless. None of the families were
provided with remedy or compensation for the
303violations suffered and for loss or damage to
their possessions.
By the end of 2014, Romani families
forcibly evicted in August 2013 from the
Craica settlement in Baia Mare in connection
with a waterworks project co-funded by the
Romanian Ministry of Environment, the EU
and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, had not been provided
with adequate alternative housing. 3 The
families continued to live in the improvised
housing they built after the 2013 demolitions.
In December 2013, the Cluj-Napoca
County Court ruled unlawful the Mayor’s
decision to forcibly evict around 300 Roma
in December 2010 from the centre of the city
and resettle them at a site adjacent to a waste
dump. The court ordered the municipality to
pay damages to the applicants and provide
them with adequate housing. In October
2014, following the municipality’s appeal, the
Cluj Court of Appeal decided to remit the case
to the Cluj District Court on the grounds that
the case was a matter of private – rather than
administrative – law, as the municipality had
acted in its capacity of landlord/landowner
rather than as a public authority. The case
was still pending at the end of the year.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
In December, a former chief of the
intelligence service confirmed that Romania
had co-operated with the CIA to establish
a secret prison in the country in 2002. The
admission followed the release of a US Senate
report detailing the CIA’s secret detention
programme and the torture of detainees. In
the report, “detention site black” was alleged
to be a secret prison in Romania.
In 2012, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a
Saudi Arabian national currently detained at
Guantánamo Bay, lodged a complaint against
Romania with the European Court of Human
Rights alleging that he had been secretly
detained in the capital, Bucharest, between
2004 and 2006.
304
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In July, the European Court of Human Rights
ruled that Romania had violated the right to
life of Valentin Câmpeanu, an HIV-positive
Romani man with a mental illness who
died due to inappropriate care and living
conditions at the Poiana Mare psychiatric
hospital in 2004.
Also in July, the Council of Europe
Commissioner for Human Rights criticized
the inadequate living conditions and ongoing
reports of ill-treatment in institutions for
adults and children with mental and physical
disabilities, despite the government’s
longstanding expressed objective to reduce
the number of people with disabilities being
held in institutions.
The Commissioner also expressed concern
over reported cases of excessive use of force
by police during searches carried out in
Romani homes in Reghin, Mureş, in 2013
and recommended the establishment of
an independent complaints mechanism for
violations by law enforcement officials.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
According to several international and
national NGOs, barriers inhibiting women’s
access to legal abortion services persisted.
These included mandatory or biased
counselling, conscientious objection by
medical practitioners, and limited information
about abortion services.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In June 2013, the parliamentary Commission
for the Revision of the Constitution passed an
amendment removing sexual orientation as
a protected ground in the anti-discrimination
provisions of the Constitution. The
Commission rejected at second voting, after
passing it initially, an amendment proposing
a change in the definition of family to freely
consented marriage between “a man and a
woman” rather than between “spouses”.

RUSSIAN
FEDERATION
Russian Federation
Head of state: Vladimir Putin
Head of government: Dmitry Medvedev
Media pluralism and the space for the
expression of dissenting views shrank
markedly. Restrictions on the rights to
freedom of expression, assembly and
association, introduced in 2012, were
assiduously enforced and further added
to. Some NGOs faced harassment, public
smear campaigns and pressure to register as
“foreign agents”. Several protesters and civil
society activists were convicted following
unfair, politically motivated trials. Torture
and other ill-treatment continued to be used
with impunity. The situation in the North
Caucasus remained volatile and marred by
human rights violations, with no effective
legal remedies for victims, and human rights
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
In February, Russia hosted the well-attended
Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. By the end
of the year, following its annexation of Crimea
from Ukraine in March and its continuing
support for separatists in Ukraine’s eastern
region of Donbass, Russia was facing
increasing international isolation.
The Russian authorities adopted an
increasingly belligerent anti-Western and anti-
Ukrainian rhetoric, which was widely echoed
in the government-controlled mainstream
media. Despite growing economic difficulties
and projected cuts in social spending –
caused in part by Western sanctions and
falling oil prices (Russia’s major export
commodity), and corruption – the Russian
leadership enjoyed a surge in popular
support, fuelled in large measure by the
widely hailed annexation of Crimea (which
had been under Russian administration in the
Soviet Union until 1954).
Fighting in Ukraine continued after a
Russian-brokered truce in September,
albeit on a reduced scale. The government
consistently denied that Russia was supplying
military hardware, personnel and other
assistance to the separatists in Donbass,
despite growing evidence to the contrary. In
occupied Crimea, Russian laws took effect,
and the rights to freedom of expression,
assembly and association were significantly
curtailed as a result.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Media and journalists
The government strengthened its control over
mainstream media, which became noticeably
less pluralistic. Most media not nominally
under state control exercised an increasing
degree of self-censorship, seldom if ever
giving platform to views unwelcome by the
authorities. Dissenting media outlets faced
considerable pressure in the form of official
305warnings, the removal of editorial staff and the
severing of business ties. Publicly owned and
private media outlets with pro-government
sympathies were used to smear political
opponents and critical voices, including
independent NGOs.
Dozhd TV was taken off air by satellite
and cable broadcasters in late January after
it initiated a controversial debate about the
siege of Leningrad in World War II. It was
also refused an extension on the lease of its
studio space. Although commercial reasons
were cited, the political influence on these
business decisions was apparent. Dozhd TV
was well known for its independent political
broadcasting, giving the floor to opposing
views and offering markedly different
coverage of EuroMaydan events in Ukraine. It
was forced to broadcast online only and resort
to “crowdfunding” to survive.
In March, the owner of online news
outlet Lenta.ru replaced its editor-in-chief
after receiving an official warning for
publishing an interview with a right-wing
Ukrainian nationalist activist who had come
to prominence during EuroMaydan. Many
members of staff resigned in protest, and
the previously independent editorial policy
changed markedly.
Greater controls were imposed on the
internet. In February a law was enacted giving
the Prosecutor’s Office the authority to order
the media regulator, Roskomnadzor, to block
websites without judicial authorization for
purported violations, including publishing
calls to participate in unauthorized
public assemblies.
In March, popular online news outlets
Ezhednevnyi Zhurnal (Daily Journal),
Grani.ru and Kasparov.ru were blocked
after reporting on the dispersal of several
peaceful spontaneous street protests in
Moscow. The Prosecutor’s Office argued
that their sympathetic reporting on these
demonstrations amounted to calls for
further “unlawful actions”. Its decision
was repeatedly upheld in subsequent legal
306
challenges and the outlets remained blocked
at the end of the year. 1
Several independent media outlets
received official warnings about “extremist”
or other purportedly unlawful content.
Independent radio station Echo Moskvy
was forced to remove a transcript from its
website of a studio discussion on 29 October
with two journalists who had witnessed the
fighting at Donetsk airport and expressed
pro-Ukrainian views. Roskomnadzor alleged
that the programme contained “information
justifying the commission of war crimes”. The
host of the discussion, Aleksandr Pliuschev,
was later suspended for two months in
connection with an unrelated inappropriate
personal tweet. His suspension was the
result of a compromise reached between the
editor-in-chief Aleksey Venediktov and the
management of Gazprom Media, the station’s
principal shareholder, who had initially
sought to dismiss Aleksandr Pliuschev and
threatened to remove Aleksey Venediktov.
Physical attacks on journalists continued.
In August, several were assaulted in separate
incidents, as they attempted to report
on secretive funerals of Russian military
servicemen allegedly killed in Ukraine.
On 29 August, Lev Shlosberg, publisher of
Pskovskaya Guberniya, the first newspaper
to report on the secret funerals, was brutally
beaten and hospitalized with head injuries.
The investigation failed to identify his three
assailants and was suspended at the end of
the year.
Timur Kuashev, a journalist from
Kabardino-Balkaria who worked closely with
local human rights defenders, was found
dead on 1 August. His unexplained death
was reportedly caused by a lethal injection.
The killings of other journalists in the North
Caucasus in previous years, including
Natalia Estemirova, Hajimurad Kamalov
and Akhmednabi Akhmednabiev, were
not effectively investigated and their killers
remained unidentified. In June, five men were
sentenced to imprisonment for the killing of
investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya
Amnesty International Report 2014/15in Moscow in October 2006, but those who
ordered her killing remained unidentified.
ACTIVISTS
Individuals and groups with dissenting views
also continued to be denied their right to
freedom of expression. Sexual minorities were
among those targeted, including under the
2013 federal law prohibiting “propaganda
of non-traditional sexual relations among
minors”. LGBTI activists were consistently
prevented from holding peaceful assemblies,
including in locations specifically designated
for public gatherings without prior permission,
typically less frequented parks with low
footfall. Courts upheld the right of LGBTI
activists to peaceful assembly in relation
to previously banned events on three
occasions, but their rulings had no impact on
future decisions.
In January, activist Elena Klimova, from
Nizhniy Tagil, was accused of “propaganda”
for her online project “Children 404” aimed
at supporting LGBTI teenagers. 2 Charges
were issued against her, then dropped, then
issued again, threatening the closure of her
project. In April, the screening of a film about
“Children 404” in Moscow was disrupted
by protesters who forced their way into the
auditorium and shouted abusive slogans.
They were accompanied by armed police who
insisted on checking the identity documents
of all those present in order to establish
whether any minors were present.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Street protest activity declined overall in
comparison to previous years, but spiked
briefly in February and March, and again in
December, in response to the Bolotnaya trial
and Russia’s military involvement in Ukraine,
and to the announced health care system
reforms and the conviction of Aleksei and
Oleg Navalny.
Onerous approval procedures for public
assemblies remained in place. With few
exceptions, most public protests were
severely restricted, barred or dispersed.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In July, penalties were significantly
increased and criminal liability punishable
by imprisonment introduced for repeated
violations of the law on public assemblies. 3
The authorities proceeded with the
prosecution of those accused in connection
with the May 2012 Bolotnaya Square protest:
10 individuals were sentenced to between two
and a half and four and a half years in prison
for their participation in and alleged violence
during the protest, which was qualified as
“mass disorder”. Sergei Udaltsov and Leonid
Razvozzhaev were convicted of organizing the
“mass disorder”.
On 20 and 24 February, police violently
dispersed hundreds of peaceful protesters
assembled outside the court building in
Moscow as it was delivering its verdict in the
Bolotnaya trial and at subsequent gatherings
in the city centre. Over 600 were arbitrarily
arrested, most of whom received fines. At
least six were sentenced to between five and
13 days’ “administrative arrest”.
In subsequent weeks, numerous
peaceful protesters were arrested, fined and
sometimes detained for their participation
in protests against Russia’s military
involvement in Ukraine and the annexation
of Crimea. At the same time, pro-government
demonstrations on Ukraine were allowed
to proceed in central locations that were
regularly denied to opposition protesters.
In Samara, several activists received
anonymous death threats after they held
a series of single-person pickets (the only
form of protest allowed without a prior
authorization) on 2 March. 4
In August, three women were briefly
detained at a police station in Moscow for
wearing clothes in blue and yellow, the
colours of the Ukrainian flag. Similar incidents
were reported across the country.
At the end of the year, small-scale protests
took place, mostly unhindered, in a number
of cities across Russia against planned health
care cuts, but in Moscow, four protesters were
sentenced to detention of between five and
30715 days after demonstrators briefly blocked
a road.
Over 200 people were detained in Moscow
on 30 December when the verdict in a
politically motivated criminal trial against
political activist Aleksei Navalny and his
brother Oleg was announced two weeks
before it was scheduled, and spontaneous
protests took place. Two detainees were
sentenced to 15 days’ detention and a further
67 held overnight and released pending trial
in January.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
Civil society activists continued to face
harassment, public attacks on their integrity
and, in some instances, criminal prosecution.
Throughout the year, independent civil
society organizations faced growing pressure
under the so-called “foreign agents law”.
This was introduced in 2012 to force NGOs
receiving foreign funding and undertaking
loosely defined “political activities” to register
as “organizations fulfilling the functions of a
foreign agent” and mark their public materials
accordingly. In 2013 and 2014, hundreds
of NGOs were subjected to intrusive official
“inspections” and dozens were embroiled
in protracted court hearings to fend off this
requirement. In May, the law was amended
to give the Ministry of Justice the authority to
register an NGO as a “foreign agent” without
its consent. By the end of the year it had
registered 29 NGOs including several leading
human rights organizations as “foreign
agents”. 5 At least five NGOs chose to dissolve
themselves as a direct result of harassment
under the “foreign agents law”.
Members of the NGO Environmental Watch
for North Caucasus (Ekovakhta), who were
highlighting environmental damage caused
by the Sochi Olympics, were subjected to
a sustained campaign of harassment by
security officials ahead of the Games. 6 Two of
them, Yevgeny Vitishko and Igor Kharchenko,
were arrested on trumped-up administrative
charges and detained during the Games’
opening. While in detention, Yevgeny
308
Vitishko lost an appeal in a criminal case on
exaggerated charges brought to silence him
and his NGO, and was transferred directly
to a prison colony to serve his three-year
sentence. 7 The work of Ekovakhta was
suspended by a court decision in March,
and the NGO was liquidated by another
decision in November, for a minor formal
transgression.
The Ministry of Justice applied to the courts
to close the Russian Society Memorial for a
purportedly incorrect form of registration. The
hearing was postponed while the NGO took
formal steps to rectify this.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
continued to be reported across the country,
while many of those who sought redress
faced pressure to withdraw their complaints.
Investigations into such allegations were
almost invariably ineffective. Confessions
extracted under torture were used as
evidence in court. In only a handful of cases,
typically involving human rights NGOs,
charges were brought against the implicated
law enforcement officials.
Members of an independent public
monitoring commission repeatedly
documented instances of torture and other
ill-treatment of detainees at the prison
colony and pre-trial detention centre IK-5 in
Sverdlovsk Region. In July, they requested
the authorities to investigate allegations of the
torture of E.G., held there on remand pending
trial, and produced photographic evidence
of his injuries. A member of the Prosecutor’s
Office responded in a letter that, based on
staff questioning at IK-5 and the paperwork
held by its administration, E.G. had not been
subjected to violence at this institution and
that his injuries predated his transfer there.
No further investigation was undertaken.
NORTH CAUCASUS
The situation in the North Caucasus remained
volatile, with armed groups engaging in
sporadic attacks against security officials.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Over 200 people reportedly lost their lives
in multiple incidents, including dozens of
civilians. Security operations, conducted in
Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Chechnya
and elsewhere, were accompanied by serious
human rights violations, including unlawful
detention, torture and other ill-treatment,
alleged enforced disappearances and
extrajudicial executions.
On 4 December, armed fighters attacked
government buildings in Grozny, Chechenya,
killing at least one civilian and 14 police
officers. The next day Ramzan Kadyrov, Head
of the Republic, publicly promised to expel
relatives of the armed group members from
Chechnya and demolish their houses. At
least 15 houses, homes to dozens of people
including small children, were burnt down or
demolished. 8 Human rights defenders who
condemned this practice and demanded an
investigation were pelted with eggs at a press
conference in Moscow on 11 December.
Ramzan Kadyrov used social media to accuse
Igor Kalyapin, leader of the Joint Mobile
Group for Chechnya, of supporting terrorists.
The Group’s office in Grozny was destroyed
by fire on 14 December in an apparent arson
attack, and its two members searched and
detained for several hours by police without
explanation, their phones, cameras and
computers confiscated.
The near-total lack of legal remedies for
victims of human rights violations prevailed,
as the criminal justice system remained
ineffective and subject – for the most
part clandestinely – to high-level political
pressure. However, in Chechnya judges and
jury members were openly admonished by
Ramzan Kadyrov for decisions in criminal
cases that he considered lenient towards
the defendants.
Reporting on human rights violations
remained a difficult, and often dangerous,
occupation, and many violations were
believed to have gone unrecorded. Human
rights defenders, independent journalists
and lawyers who worked on cases involving
human rights violations continued to face
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
threats and harassment from law enforcement
officials and unidentified individuals.
Civil society activist Ruslan Kutaev
complained of torture, including beatings and
electrocution, after his arrest in February on
trumped-up charges of heroin possession.
His injuries were well documented by
independent monitors. 9 However, the
investigative authorities accepted the alleged
perpetrators’ explanation that Ruslan Kutaev’s
injuries resulted from a fall, and refused to
investigate his complaints further. He was
convicted following an unfair trial in July in
Urus-Martan, Chechnya, and sentenced to
four years in prison, reduced by two months
on appeal in October.
Dagestani lawyer Sapiyat Magomedova,
who was seriously assaulted by police in 2010
at a police station when visiting a detained
client, continued to receive anonymous
death threats and threats from investigation
officials, both veiled and open. None of
her official complaints were effectively
investigated. She remained concerned for
her own, her colleagues’ and her family’s
safety, but refused to give up her work. 10
The investigation into her beating by police
in 2010 was formally reopened, but the
authorities failed to demonstrate any progress
or intention to prosecute her assailants.

RWANDA
Republic of Rwanda
Head of state: Paul Kagame
Head of government: Anastase Murekezi (replaced
Pierre Damien Habumuremyi in July)
Freedoms of expression and association in
Rwanda continued to be unduly restricted
by the authorities. Rwandans were unable
to openly express critical views on issues
perceived as sensitive by the authorities
and the environment for journalists, human
rights defenders and members of the
opposition remained repressive. There were
reports of unlawful detention by Rwandan
military intelligence and past cases of
torture were not investigated.
BACKGROUND
2014 marked the 20 th anniversary of the 1994
genocide in which around 800,000 Rwandan
Tutsi and Hutu opposed to the government
were killed. Around the world, events held
310
to remember the victims reiterated the need
for the international community to continue
to improve its response to emerging mass
atrocities. 1
Economic progress and development
continued. However, the political landscape
continued to be dominated by the ruling
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) without
any meaningful opposition. The authorities
continued to react harshly to any criticism,
especially regarding its human rights record.
In late July, President Kagame reshuffled
the cabinet and Prime Minister Habumuremyi
was replaced. The President of the Senate,
Jean-Damascène Ntawukuriryayo, resigned
in September.
In June, a report by the UN Group
of Experts noted that the fate of former
combatants and political cadres of the March
23 Movement (M23) armed group remained
unresolved, including escapes of individuals
from camps in Rwanda. Many M23 members
had fled to Rwanda following their defeat by
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
troops in late 2013.
POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS ABROAD
The Rwandan government denied allegations
that they were linked to successful or
attempted assassinations of political
dissidents abroad.
On 1 January, Patrick Karegeya, a leading
member of the opposition Rwandan National
Congress (RNC) and former Head of External
Intelligence (RDF), was found dead in a
hotel room in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Investigations into his killing were carried out;
however, the perpetrators were not identified.
Public statements following his death by the
Rwandan authorities, including President
Kagame, sought to justify the killing of people
who were traitors to the country.
In August, a South African Court found
four men guilty of the 2010 attempted
assassination of Kayumba Nyamwasa, an
exiled RNC dissident and former Chief of Staff
of the RDF. The judge was cited in media
Amnesty International Report 2014/15reports as saying that the main culprits for the
attempted assassination remained at large.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders were subjected to
personalized attacks and threats and faced
intimidation and administrative obstacles.
Space for criticism of the country’s human
rights record by civil society was almost
non-existent. The human rights community
remained weakened, with individuals
taking a pro-government position in their
work or employing self-censorship to avoid
harassment by the authorities.
In August, Transparency International (TI)
issued a statement reporting security risks
experienced by its staff. According to TI, an
armed man had attempted to enter its offices
on 29 July and another staff member had
reported security threats at his home. The
killing in July 2013 of Gustave Makonene,
who worked for TI, had a chilling effect on
other activists working on potentially sensitive
issues, such as corruption.
On 8 August, the High Court of Nyarugenge
in Kigali ruled that the current executive
committee of the Rwandan League for the
Promotion and Defense of Human Rights
(LIPRODHOR) should remain in place. The
complaint had been brought by the former
President of LIPRODHOR who had been
ousted in July 2013 in a move supported
by the Rwanda Governance Board, an
official body charged with promoting and
monitoring good governance in Rwanda.
The complainant lodged an appeal against
the judgment.
POLITICAL PRISONERS
Following the rejection of her appeal in
December 2013, Victoire Ingabire, President
of the United Democratic Forces party
(FDU-Inkingi), remained in Kigali Central
Prison serving a 15-year prison sentence for
terrorism-related and freedom of expression
offences. Some of the evidence used to
convict her was linked to the legitimate
expression of her ideas. Victoire Ingabire had
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
returned to Rwanda in January 2010 after 16
years in exile in Europe.
Bernard Ntaganda, President of the Ideal
Social Party (Parti Social-Imberakuri), was
released from Mpanga prison after four
years in detention. He had been found guilty
in 2011 of “divisionism” for making public
speeches criticizing government policies
ahead of the 2010 elections, breaching
state security and attempting to plan an
“unauthorized demonstration”.
FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION
AND EXPRESSION
People continued to be imprisoned for the
legitimate exercise of their rights to freedom
of association or of expression.
Sylvain Sibomana and Anselme
Mutuyimana, members of FDU-Inkingi,
remained in prison. Both were sentenced in
January following their conviction for inciting
insurrection or trouble among the population
after organizing a meeting in Rutsiro district
in September 2012. An appeal was lodged
against the convictions. Six members of FDU-
Inkingi were released on 5 September after
serving a two-year sentence for attending the
same meeting in Rutsiro. Sylvain Sibomana
was also convicted of participating in illegal
gatherings for taking part in a demonstration
outside the Supreme Court during Victoire
Ingabire’s appeal in March 2013.
Political parties
The few opposition parties permitted faced a
repressive environment. Legal procedures for
establishing political parties remained lengthy
and time-consuming.
The Democratic Green Party of Rwanda
(DGPR), which had been granted official
registration in August 2013, called for an
investigation to establish the whereabouts of
a leading party member, Jean Damascène
Munyeshyaka, who was last seen on
27 June 2014 in Nyamata, Bugesera
District. The DGPR alleged that prior to his
disappearance he had received a telephone
call from an individual requesting that
they meet immediately. The DGPR had
311previously reported administrative obstacles
in registering and state surveillance,
harassment and intimidation because of their
political activities.
UNLAWFUL DETENTIONS
BY THE MILITARY
Reports of unlawful detentions by the RDF
continued. People were held in detention
centres that were not part of the Rwanda
Correctional Service, without access to
lawyers or due process.
Past allegations of torture, including
beatings, electric shocks and sensory
deprivation, were not investigated.
The authorities rejected criticism of alleged
unlawful detentions by military intelligence
made by the US and UK governments. On 4
June 2014, President Kagame responded to
recent reports by saying that those seeking to
destabilize the country would be arrested or
even killed.
UNFAIR TRIALS – STATE
SECURITY TRIALS
High-ranking military officers were held
on state security charges. The authorities
failed to respect due process in their
treatment of people suspected of terrorism-
related offences.
The trial of Joel Mutabazi and 15
others ended in October. Joel Mutabazi, a
former bodyguard to President Kagame,
was convicted of plotting attacks against
the government and sentenced to life
imprisonment. He announced his intention to
appeal the verdict. Many of his co-accused
stated in court that they had been tortured
and forced to make confessions. However,
the court failed to investigate these
allegations. Joel Mutabazi had been detained
incommunicado by Rwanda’s Department of
Military Intelligence at Camp Kami for several
months in 2010 and 2011 and tortured. He
had fled to Uganda, where he was under the
protection of the Ugandan authorities, but in
October 2013 he was abducted and illegally
returned to Rwanda.
312
Four people – Kizito Mihigo, a singer;
Cassien Ntamuhanga, a journalist
with Amazing Grace Radio; Jean Paul
Dukuzumuremyi, a demobilized soldier; and
Agnes Nyibizi, an accountant – were arrested
in April and charged with state security
offences. Official reports indicated they were
accused of having been recruited by the RNC
and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Rwanda, an armed group based in eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and of
planning terrorist activities. It was reported
that Kizito Mihigo may have held critical
conversations by email with the opposition
abroad; however, this remained unconfirmed.
The four were detained pending trial at the
end of the year.
In August, Rwandan military intelligence
arrested four individuals linked to the RDF.
They faced charges including tarnishing the
image of the country or government, inciting
insurrection or trouble among the population,
concealing objects which were used or meant
to commit an offence, and illegal possession
of firearms. Three faced trials before a
military court – Colonel Tom Byabagamba,
retired General Frank Rusagara and Sergeant
François Kabayiza. Captain David Kabuye was
due to be tried before a civilian court. All four
trials were pending at the end of 2014.
PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
In June, Agnès Nkusi Uwimana, editor of the
private Kinyarwanda-language newspaper
Umurabyo, was released after completing
a four-year prison sentence. She had been
imprisoned for threatening state security after
writing opinion pieces critical of government
policies and alleged corruption in the run-up
to the 2010 presidential elections.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Trials of people suspected of involvement in
the Rwandan genocide continued in national
courts outside Rwanda.
On 18 February, former Mayor Onesphore
Rwabukombe was found guilty of aiding and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15abetting genocide and was sentenced to 14
years’ imprisonment by a German court.
On 14 March, a former Rwandan army
captain, Pascal Simbikangwa, was found
guilty by a French court of complicity in
genocide and crimes against humanity.
The court found that he played a key role in
drawing up lists of Tutsi and moderate Hutu
leaders to be targeted and contributed to
the setting up of Radio Mille Collines, which
broadcast messages inciting violence. He was
sentenced to 25 years in prison. It was the
first time a French court had tried a genocide
suspect. Six other genocide suspects in
France were awaiting trial or on trial at the
end of the year.
On 7 May, the Quebec Superior Court
upheld Désiré Munyaneza’s conviction by a
Canadian court for genocide, crimes against
humanity and war crimes.
On 19 June, a Swedish court confirmed the
sentence of life imprisonment for Stanislas
Mbanenande for his role in five massacres in
Kibuye during the genocide.
Extradition trials of four genocide suspects
in the UK continued during the year.
In April, a Norwegian court sentenced Sadi
Bugingo to 21 years’ imprisonment for his
role in the genocide. His appeal was pending
at the end of the year. The request to the
Norwegian authorities for the extradition of
another genocide suspect was approved, but
pending appeal at the end of the year.
In the Netherlands, the extraditions of two
men were pending at the end of the year and
in Denmark another genocide suspect was
awaiting trial.
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
The International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda prepared to close down its
operations. It had one case pending appeal at
the end of 2014. The tribunal had completed
75 cases, 14 of which ended in acquittals and
10 were transferred to national jurisdictions.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15
SAUDI ARABIA
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Head of state and government: King Abdullah bin
Abdul Aziz Al Saud
The government severely restricted freedoms
of expression, association and assembly,
and cracked down on dissent, arresting
and imprisoning critics, including human
rights defenders. Many received unfair trials
before courts that failed to respect due
process, including a special anti-terrorism
court that handed down death sentences.
New legislation effectively equated criticism
of the government and other peaceful
activities with terrorism. The authorities
clamped down on online activism and
intimidated activists and family members
who reported human rights violations.
Discrimination against the Shi’a minority
remained entrenched; some Shi’a activists
were sentenced to death and scores received
lengthy prison terms. Torture of detainees
was reportedly common; courts convicted
defendants on the basis of torture-tainted
“confessions” and sentenced others to
flogging. Women faced discrimination in
law and practice, and were inadequately
protected against sexual and other violence
despite a new law criminalizing domestic
violence. The authorities detained and
summarily expelled thousands of foreign
migrants, returning some to countries where
they were at risk of serious human rights
abuses. The authorities made extensive use
of the death penalty and carried out dozens
of public executions.
BACKGROUND
The government adopted increasingly tough
measures against its critics and opponents,
who ranged from peaceful dissidents to
armed Islamist militants, reflected by its
introduction and enforcement of sweeping
new and severe anti-terrorism legislation. The
313authorities publicly deterred citizens from
contributing funds, recruits or other support
to militant Sunni armed groups in Syria
and Iraq.
In September, Saudi Arabia joined the
US-led military alliance formed to combat the
Islamic State armed group and other armed
groups in Syria and Iraq.
The UN Human Rights Council completed
its Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia
in March. The government accepted the
majority of the recommendations but rejected
substantive calls, such as one urging Saudi
Arabia to ratify the ICCPR. The government
committed to dismantling or abolishing the
male guardianship system and to allowing
women greater freedom to travel, study, work
and marry, but it had taken no discernible
steps to implement these commitments by
the end of the year.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
The government remained intolerant of
dissent and repressed its critics, including
bloggers and other online commentators,
political and women’s rights activists,
members of the Shi’a minority, and
human rights activists and defenders. The
government continued to ban judges from
using social media for any purpose.
In May, a court in Jeddah sentenced
blogger Raif Badawi to 10 years in prison and
a flogging of 1,000 lashes after convicting
him on charges that included “insulting
Islam” for establishing the website Saudi
Arabian Liberals, which promoted political
and social debate, and for criticizing some
religious leaders. He was initially charged
with apostasy, which carries the death
penalty. The court also ordered the closure
of the website. His prison term and flogging
sentence were confirmed by the Court of
Appeal in September.
In October, the Specialized Criminal Court
(SCC) in Riyadh sentenced three lawyers
– Dr Abdulrahman al-Subaihi, Bander
al-Nogaithan and Abdulrahman al-Rumaih
314
– to prison terms of up to eight years to
be followed by bans on travel abroad after
convicting them of “impinging public order”
by using Twitter to criticize the Ministry
of Justice. The court also banned them
indefinitely from using any media outlets
including social media.
The government did not permit the
existence of political parties, trade unions
and independent human rights groups, and
it arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned those
who set up or participated in unlicenced
organizations.
The government continued to deny
Amnesty International access to Saudi Arabia
and took punitive action against activists and
family members of victims who contacted
Amnesty International.
All public gatherings, including
demonstrations, remained prohibited under
an order issued by the Interior Ministry in
2011. Those who sought to defy the ban
faced arrest, prosecution and imprisonment
on charges such as “inciting people against
the authorities”. In October, the government
warned that it would arrest anyone who defied
the ban by supporting the campaign for
women drivers (see below).
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
The authorities targeted the small but vocal
community of human rights defenders,
using anti-terrorism laws to suppress their
peaceful actions to expose and address
human rights violations. Those detained
or serving sentences included founding
members and activists of the Saudi Civil
and Political Rights Association (ACPRA),
an officially unrecognized group founded in
2009 which campaigns for the release or fair
trial of long-term political detainees. At the
end of the year, four ACPRA members were
serving prison sentences of up to 15 years,
three others were detained pending their trial
outcomes, and two were detained without
trial. The latter were Abdulrahman al-Hamid,
arrested after he signed a statement in April
calling for the Interior Minister to be put on
Amnesty International Report 2014/15trial, and Saleh al-Ashwan, held without
charge since 2012. Two other ACPRA
activists were at liberty awaiting the outcome
of their trials. Those convicted were serving
sentences imposed on vague, overly broad
charges designed to stifle peaceful criticism.
Other activists faced trial on similar charges.
In July, the SCC sentenced leading
human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair
to 15 years in prison, followed by a 15-year
ban on travelling abroad, after convicting
him on vague, overly broad charges arising
from his peaceful and professional human
rights activities.
In November, the Criminal Court in
al-Khobar in the Eastern Province sentenced
human rights defender Mikhlif bin Daham
al-Shammari to two years in prison and a
flogging of 200 lashes after convicting him on
charges of “stirring public opinion by sitting
with the Shi’a” and “violating the rulers’
instructions by holding a private gathering
and tweeting”. He already faced a five-year
prison term, followed by a 10-year travel ban,
imposed on him by the SCC in June 2013.
The SCC also banned him from writing in the
press and on social media websites, and from
appearing on television or radio. The SCC’s
appeal chamber confirmed this sentence in
June 2014.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
A new anti-terrorism law that took effect in
February, following approval by the King,
extended the authorities’ already sweeping
powers to combat “acts of terror”. The new
law failed to define terrorism but provided that
words and actions deemed by the authorities
to be directly or indirectly “disturbing” to
public order, “destabilizing the security of
society, or the stability of the state”, “revoking
the basic law of government”, or “harming the
reputation of the state or its standing” would
be considered terrorist acts. In March, a
series of decrees promulgated by the Interior
Ministry extended Saudi Arabia’s already wide
definition of terrorism to include “calling for
atheist thought” and “contacting any groups
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
or individuals opposed to the Kingdom”, as
well as “seeking to disrupt national unity” by
calling for protests, and “harming other states
and their leaders”. In violation of international
standards, the new decrees had retroactive
effect, exposing those alleged to have
committed acts in the past to prosecution
on terrorism as well as other charges if they
commit any new offence.
In July, the Ministry of Justice reaffirmed
the exclusive jurisdiction of the SCC over
cases involving alleged offences against
state security.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Security authorities carried out arbitrary
arrests and continued to hold detainees
without charge or trial for long periods,
with scores of people held for more than
six months without being referred to a
competent court, in breach of the country’s
Code of Criminal Procedures. Detainees
were frequently held incommunicado during
interrogation and denied access to lawyers, in
violation of international fair trial standards.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
common and widespread, according to
former detainees, trial defendants and others,
and were used with impunity. In a number
of cases, courts convicted defendants
solely on the basis of pre-trial “confessions”
without investigating their claims that these
confessions had been extracted under torture,
in some cases sentencing the defendants
to death.
Some prisoners sentenced on political
grounds in previous years were reportedly
ill-treated in prison, including the imprisoned
ACPRA activists Dr Abdullah al-Hamid and
Dr Mohammad al-Qahtani, who went on
hunger strike in March to protest against their
conditions. In August, Jeddah prison guards
reportedly beat imprisoned human rights
lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair when forcibly
removing him from his cell before transferring
him to another prison.
315DISCRIMINATION – SHI’A MINORITY WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Members of the Shi’a minority, most of whom
live in the oil-rich Eastern Province, continued
to face entrenched discrimination that limited
their access to government services and
employment, and impacted them in many
other ways. Members of the Shi’a community
remained mostly excluded from senior posts.
Shi’a leaders and activists faced arrest,
imprisonment following unfair trials, and the
death penalty.
In May, the SCC sentenced Ali Mohammed
Baqir al-Nimr to death after convicting him on
charges that included demonstrating against
the government, possession of weapons and
attacking the security forces. He denied the
charges and told the court that he had been
tortured and forced to confess in pre-trial
detention. The court convicted him without
investigating his torture allegations, and
sentenced him to death although he was
aged 17 at the time of the alleged offences.
In October, his uncle, Sheikh Nimr Baqir
al-Nimr, a Shi’a cleric from Qatif and vocal
critic of the government’s treatment of the
Shi’a minority, was sentenced to death by the
SCC. Security forces arrested Sheikh al-Nimr
in July 2012 in disputed circumstances in
which he was shot and paralyzed in one
leg. In August, the SCC sentenced another
prominent Shi’a cleric, Sheikh Tawfiq al-‘Amr,
to eight years in prison, to be followed by
a 10-year ban on overseas travel and a
ban on delivering religious sermons and
public speeches.
In September, the SCC imposed a fine
and a 14-year prison sentence followed by
a 15-year foreign travel ban on Shi’a rights
activist Fadhel al-Manasif after convicting him
on charges that included “breaking allegiance
with the ruler” and maintaining “contact with
foreign news organizations”. The sentence
was upheld by the SCC’s appeal division
in December.
The SCC sentenced other Shi’a activists for
their alleged participation in the protests of
2011 and 2012. At least five received death
sentences; others received long prison terms. Women and girls remained subject to
discrimination in law and practice. Women
had subordinate status to men under the
law, particularly in relation to family matters
such as marriage, divorce, child custody
and inheritance, and they were inadequately
protected against sexual and other violence.
Domestic violence reportedly remained
endemic, despite a government awareness-
raising campaign launched in 2013. A 2013
law criminalizing domestic violence was not
implemented in practice due to a lack of
competent authorities to enforce it.
Women who supported the Women2Drive
campaign, launched in 2011 to challenge
the prohibition on women driving vehicles,
faced harassment and intimidation by the
authorities, who warned that women drivers
would face arrest. Some were arrested
but released after a short period. In early
December, Loujain al-Hathloul and Mayssa
al-Amoudi, two supporters of the campaign,
were arrested at the border with the United
Arab Emirates for driving their cars. The
authorities later brought terrorism-related
charges against both women, who remained
in detention at the end of the year.
Women’s rights activist Souad al-Shammari
was detained in October after Bureau of
Investigation and Prosecution officials in
Jeddah summoned her for questioning. She
was held without charge at Briman prison in
Jeddah at the end of the year.
Women’s rights activists Wajeha
al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Oyouni, whose
10-month prison sentences and two-year
foreign travel bans were confirmed by an
appeal court in 2013, remained at liberty.
The authorities did not explain their failure to
summon them to prison.
In April, two daughters of the King accused
him of having held them and their two sisters
captive within a royal compound for 13 years,
and of denying them adequate food.
316
Amnesty International Report 2014/15MIGRANT WORKERS’ RIGHTS
After granting foreign workers several months
to regularize their status, the government
launched a crackdown on irregular foreign
migrants in November 2013, arresting,
detaining and deporting hundreds of
thousands of foreign workers in order to open
more jobs to Saudi Arabians. In March, the
Interior Minister stated that the authorities
had deported over 370,000 foreign migrants
in the preceding five months and that 18,000
others were in detention. Thousands of
workers were summarily returned to Somalia
and other states where they were at risk of
human rights abuses, with large numbers also
returned to Yemen. Many migrants reported
that prior to their deportation they had been
packed into severely overcrowded makeshift
detention facilities where they received little
food and water and were abused by guards.
CRUEL, INHUMAN OR
DEGRADING PUNISHMENT
The courts continued to impose sentences
of flogging as punishment for many offences.
Blogger Raif Badawi was sentenced to a
flogging of 1,000 lashes in addition to a prison
sentence. Human rights defender Mikhlif bin
Daham al-Shammari was sentenced to 200
lashes as well as a prison term.
In September, the authorities released
Ruth Cosrojas, a Filipino domestic worker
sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment and
300 lashes after an unfair trial in October
2013 where she was convicted of organizing
the sale of sex (quwada). She had received
150 lashes by the time of her release.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts continued to impose death sentences
for a range of crimes, including some that
did not involve violence, such as “sorcery”,
adultery and drug offences, frequently after
unfair trials. Some defendants, including
foreign nationals facing murder charges,
alleged that they had been tortured or
otherwise coerced or misled into making false
confessions in pre-trial detention.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
The authorities carried out dozens of
executions, many by public beheading. Those
executed included both Saudi nationals and
foreign migrants.
SENEGAL
Republic of Senegal
Head of state: Macky Sall
Head of government: Mohammed Dionne (replaced
Aminata Touré in July)
Police used excessive force to suppress
demonstrations. Conditions in prison
continued to be harsh. There was some
progress in overcoming impunity for past
human rights violations, although many
cases remained unresolved. The long-
running conflict in Casamance was less
intense than in previous years.
BACKGROUND
In September 2013 the Minister of Justice
committed to opening an official commission
of inquiry into poor detention conditions in
the Liberty 6 and Rebeuss prisons, but by the
end of 2014 no progress had been made.
In March 2014, the UN Human Rights
Council adopted the outcome of the Universal
Periodic Review on Senegal. During the
review process Amnesty International had
raised concerns about excessive use of
force by security forces to repress freedom
of expression and assembly, torture and
other ill-treatment, deaths in detention,
and impunity for human rights violations,
including some dating back 30 years. Senegal
committed to protect the rights to freedom of
expression, association and assembly; and to
ensure that its security forces maintain public
order without resorting to excessive use of
force. However, it rejected recommendations
to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the
ICCPR, aiming at the abolition of the death
317penalty, despite having committed to ratify
it in a meeting with Amnesty International
in December 2013. Senegal also rejected
recommendations to amend national
legislation to protect LGBTI people from
discrimination, and claimed that there were
no cases of enforced disappearance in
Senegal despite repeated concerns raised
by Amnesty International about the fate of
dozens of disappeared Casamance people at
the hands of government forces.
The corruption trial of Karim Wade, a
former minister and son of former President
Abdoulaye Wade, and other defendants,
began in July. Karim Wade was charged with
illicit acquisition of wealth and stood trial
before the Court for the Repression of Illicit
Acquisition of Wealth, which does not allow
for appeals after the verdict.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
In January, in Oulampane, Casamance, high
school students demonstrated to call for more
teachers. Military forces intervened using
live ammunition, injuring four students. The
Army Command condemned these actions
by military forces and announced that there
would be accountability, although no concrete
steps were taken and no investigation was
opened during the year.
Throughout August, students protested
against delays in paying scholarships at
Cheikh-Anta-Diop University in Dakar and
there were repeated confrontations with
security forces. Student Bassirou Faye died
after being shot in the head by police during
a demonstration. A police officer was arrested
in October and charged with his murder.
In September a convicted prisoner was
shot dead in Sinthiou Roudji, near the town
of Kédougou. His sentence allowed him to
work out of prison during the day and return
to the prison facility at night. Upon failure to
return, security forces were sent for him, and
he was shot by a security officer, reportedly
while trying to flee. The Ministry of Justice
committed to opening an investigation, and
the officer was remanded in custody.
318
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Authorities prosecuted demonstrators
who participated in or spoke out during
demonstrations organized by political parties
and NGOs.
Rapper Malal Talla, a leader of the Y’en a
marre (We have had enough) movement, was
arrested and detained for four days in June
for denouncing police racketeering at a public
gathering. He was charged with insulting the
police, before being released after a judge
determined that the charges were unfounded.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In February, police arrested four young men
who had attacked five gay men in Rufisque,
a town outside Dakar. Residents of the town
marched in support of the accused, calling
for their release.
IMPUNITY
The trial of police officers implicated in the
death in custody of Dominique Lopy in 2007
was postponed from June to November 2014
at the request of the defendants’ lawyers.
The trial of two gendarmerie commanders
charged with killing demonstrators in two
separate incidents in 2011 and 2012 was still
pending. They were released from detention
pending trial.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
Former Chadian President Hissène Habré
remained in custody awaiting trial before the
Extraordinary African Chambers created by
the AU in 2012 to try him in Senegal. On
30 June 2013 Hissène Habré was arrested,
and was charged on 2 July 2013 with crimes
against humanity, torture and war crimes
committed in Chad between 1982 and 1990.
In August the court rejected the Chadian
government’s request to be a civil party
(partie civile) in the case. The court asked
that Chad extradite certain key witnesses,
but this request was refused. The court also
asked the AU to intervene in the matter.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
The conflict between the army and the
Democratic Forces of Casamance Movement
(MFDC) became less intense, and one MFDC
leader proclaimed a unilateral ceasefire
in April.
Civilians continued to suffer from the
impact of ongoing conflict, which rendered
thousands unemployed or displaced from
their villages. At least seven men were killed
by landmines in August.
SERBIA
Republic of Serbia, including Kosovo
Head of state: Tomislav Nikolić
Head of government: Aleksandar Vučić (replaced
Ivica Dačić in April)
Progress was made in investigations into the
unsolved murders of prominent journalists.
Slow progress was made in the prosecution
of war crimes. The Belgrade Pride took
place for the first time since being banned
in 2010. In Kosovo, a special court was
proposed to try former members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) for the
abduction of Serbs in 1999. Violence in the
north of Kosovo, inter-ethnic attacks and
discrimination against minorities continued.
BACKGROUND
The Serbian Progressive Party took over the
government in April. In May, severe flooding
left 51 dead and tens of thousands homeless.
Before the opening of negotiations
on accession to the EU, the European
Commission called for action plans on the
rule of law and fundamental rights, and
commitment to the “normalization” of
relations with Kosovo.
The government adopted austerity
measures, as required by the International
Monetary Fund, which included cuts to
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
public sector salaries and state pensions and
restrictions on trade unions.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
In January, the Appeals Chamber at the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) upheld the conviction of
Vlastimir Djordjević, former Serbian Assistant
to the Minister of the Interior, for murder and
persecution – including sexual assaults as
crimes against humanity – and the forced
deportation of 800,000 Kosovo Albanians. His
sentence was reduced on appeal, along with
those of three other senior officials, Nikola
Šainović, Sreten Lukić and Vladimir Lazarević.
Former military commander Nebojša
Pavković’s 22-year sentence was affirmed.
Vojislav Šešelj, leader of the Serb Radical
Party, indicted in 2003 for war crimes and
crimes against humanity, including the forced
deportation and persecution of non-Serbs
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and
Vojvodina, was granted provisional release in
November to receive treatment for cancer and
returned to Serbia after 12 years in detention.
Domestic prosecutions were hampered
by insufficient resources in the Office of
the War Crimes Prosecutor and inadequate
police investigations. 1 Five indictments were
published, and verdicts reached at first
instance in only one case.
The Head of the Witness Protection
Unit, which was alleged to have intimidated
protected witnesses, was dismissed in June,
allegedly for corruption. Prosecutors, police
and witnesses received threats from war
veterans while investigating the abduction of
19 civilians by Bosnian Serb paramilitaries
in Štrpci in 1992. Fifteen suspects were
subsequently arrested in December, in a joint
operation with the Bosnian authorities.
An investigation started in August into
Major General Dragan Živanović’s command
responsibility for war crimes in Kosovo,
between 1 April and 15 May 1999, when
he was commander of the 125th Motorized
Brigade. He was suspected of failing to
prevent “a campaign of terror against
319Albanian civilians”, including murder,
the destruction of houses, plunder and
forced expulsion.
A new law proposed in December failed to
ensure adequate reparation for civilian victims
of war, including relatives of the missing and
victims of war crimes of sexual violence.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Despite the exhumation of the bodies of 53
Kosovo Albanian civilians at Raška, where
they had been reburied in 1999, and further
investigations at Batajnica, where over 800
bodies were exhumed in 2000-2001, there
was no progress in bringing to justice those
who organized the transfer of the bodies
from Kosovo.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The government tightened its hold on the
media. Public comments critical of the
government's response to the May floods,
were removed from government websites, and
critical individuals summoned for “informative
talks” by police. The Pesčanik website was
taken down by denial-of-service attacks, after
publishing allegations of plagiarism by the
Minister of the Interior.
Investigations continued into the murders
of independent journalists, Dada Vujasinović,
Slavko Ćuruvija and Milan Pantić, allegedly
killed by state agents in 1994, 1999 and
2001 respectively. Four suspects were
charged with the murder of Slavko Ćuruvija,
including former national security chief,
Radomir Marković, previously convicted for
the 2000 assassination of former President
Ivan Stambolić.
In December, 11 foreign nationals and
supporters of the Falun Gong movement
were unlawfully detained after their proposed
protest against the Chinese government was
banned, and subsequently deported.
Roma settlements were disproportionately
affected by flooding in May, and 31 Roma
(including 12 children), were denied access
to an emergency reception centre in Belgrade
and rehoused in a wartime shelter, without
water or sanitation.
The EU-funded construction of social
housing for Roma forcibly evicted from
Belvil informal settlement in 2012 was
delayed, even after resettlement sites were
identified. Some 32 families chose instead
to be resettled in village houses, but over
100 other families remained in inadequate
metal containers. Another resettlement from
Belvil, ahead of construction funded by the
European Investment Bank, was delayed until
December, when 24 of the 50 families were
resettled. Roma and others remained at risk
of forced eviction in advance of the planned
demolition of their homes for the Belgrade
Waterfront project.
Hate crimes
Threats and attacks against LGBTI rights
defenders and organizations, including the
Gay-Straight Alliance, were not effectively
investigated, and the hate motive was seldom
recognized and provisions for increased
sentencing in cases of hate crime were
rarely invoked.
In March, a police anti-terrorist
spokesperson urged football fans online to
attack a vigil by the NGO Women in Black,
marking the anniversary of the Kosovo war.
Prosecutors charged him with making threats
to security, rather than with gender-based
discrimination, so the hate motivation was
not considered. In July, four members of the
group were attacked and injured in Valjevo.
In October, after a drone bearing the
symbol of Greater Albania was flown over a
Serbia-Albania football match in Belgrade, at
least 33 properties owned by Albanians were
attacked, mainly in Vojvodina.
DISCRIMINATION REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Roma right to adequate housing Between January and October, 18,955
Serbian citizens applied for asylum in the EU,
the majority of them believed to be Roma.
Roma organizations initiated a draft law on
the legalization of informal Roma settlements.
320
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Around 13,000 migrants and refugees,
including 8,000 Syrians, registered their
intent to claim asylum in Serbia, although
most regarded Serbia as a transit country.
Only five applicants had received asylum
by mid-December in a refugee status
determination process which failed to follow
procedures set out in the Asylum Law. Border
police reportedly pushed asylum-seekers and
migrants back to Macedonia.
KOSOVO
Following parliamentary elections held in
June, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, led
by Hashim Thaçi, failed to gain a majority
over a coalition of opposition parties,
leading to a political impasse. In December,
a coalition government with Isa Mustafa
of the Democratic League of Kosovo as
Prime Minister, was formed. Atifete Jahjaga
continued as President. From June,
EU-brokered talks on the normalization of
relations with Serbia continued only at a
technical level.
The mandate of the EU-led Police and
Justice Mission (EULEX) was extended until
June 2016. Under the new agreement,
international judges no longer formed
the majority on judicial panels in cases of
serious crimes.
The EU High Representative in November
announced an independent inquiry
into allegations of corruption against a
EULEX judge.
Inter-ethnic violence
Inter-ethnic tensions continued, particularly
in the Serbian dominated north. Some
Serbian politicians were prevented from
entering Kosovo, and Kosovo Serbs, including
returnees to Klina/Klinë in February and
October, were subject to attacks – including
arson – on their property, graveyards and
religious buildings, which intensified after the
Serbia-Albania football match in October.
In June, after clashes between Kosovo
Police and Albanians demonstrating against
the closure of the bridge over the river Ibar
(which divides the Serbian and Albanian
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
parts of Mitrovica), international EULEX police
fired rubber bullets at demonstrators. The
UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) had banned
their use after two men were killed in Pristina
in 2007.
Crimes under international law
In July, a Special Investigative Task Force,
established by EULEX to investigate
allegations against senior KLA members,
announced that unnamed individuals would
be indicted for war crimes and crimes
against humanity, including the unlawful
killing, abduction, illegal detention, crimes
of sexual violence against and forced
displacement of Kosovo Serbs and Albanian
civilians, unlawfully transferred to Albania
in 1999. Suspects will be indicted and tried
by a special court, yet to be established,
outside of Kosovo in order to ensure effective
witness protection.
In October, two protected witnesses
contradicted their original testimonies during
the retrial of seven members of the former
KLA “Drenica” group, charged with war
crimes against Albanians at Likovc/Likovac
camp in 1998.
The retrial opened in September of Fatmir
Limaj and nine others accused of the torture
and ill-treatment of Albanian civilians at the
Klečka/Klecke camp in 1999. They had been
acquitted in September 2013, following the
suicide of a protected witness on which the
prosecution case relied.
Kosovo Serb political leader Oliver Ivanović,
arrested in January, was indicted in August
for incitement to commit war crimes in 1999,
and incitement to aggravated murder in
February 2000.
War crimes of sexual violence
In March, President Jahjaga launched
a national council for the survivors of
wartime sexual violence, to encourage
them to come forward to claim reparation,
including compensation, as set out in legal
amendments adopted by the Assembly later
in March.
In June, the Appeal Court overturned the
acquittal of two Kosovo Serbs, and convicted
321them of war crimes for the rape of a 16-year-
old Albanian girl in April 1999. They were
sentenced to 12 and 10 years’ imprisonment.
Enforced disappearances
Relatives of the disappeared protested
against legal provisions ending their monthly
compensation of €135 after the body of their
family member was found. By November,
1,655 people remained missing after the
armed conflict. The remains of 53 Kosovo
Albanians exhumed at Raška were returned
to their relatives by October.
UNMIK failed to provide reparation,
including compensation, to the relatives of
missing Kosovo Serbs, as recommended by
the Human Rights Advisory Panel.
Freedom of expression
Government and state agencies unduly
influenced the media through major
contributions to their advertizing revenue.
Attacks on investigative journalists continued.
Visar Duriqi, a journalist for the newspaper
Express, received serious death threats
after reporting on Islamic extremist groups.
The Association of Professional Journalists
expressed concerns that EULEX had put
pressure on Koha Ditore journalist, Vehbi
Kajtazi, who had reported alleged corruption
in EULEX.
In May, the first march celebrating the
International Day against Homophobia and
Transphobia took place without incident.
discrimination, yet few measures for their
integration were implemented. Around 360
families (1,700 individuals) had reportedly
migrated from Kosovo by November, to seek
asylum in Hungary. Plans to build housing
for Roma in Hereq village, Gjakovë/Djakovica,
were opposed by local residents.
Refugees and asylum-seekers
According to UNHCR, the UN refugee
agency, 17,227 people – the majority of
them Kosovo Serbs – remained displaced
after the armed conflict. By 30 November,
only 404 members of minority communities
had voluntarily returned to Kosovo, where
conditions for their reintegration remained
grossly inadequate. By October, 11,000
people from Kosovo had applied for asylum
in the EU.

SIERRA LEONE
Republic of Sierra Leone
Head of state and government: Ernest Bai Koroma
Discrimination – hate crimes
In March, three men were convicted and
given suspended sentences for “Violating the
Equal Status of Residents of Kosovo” for their
part in an attack in 2012 on the launch of an
issue of “Kosovo 2.0” online magazine, on
sexual orientation and identity. No one was
brought to justice for an attack on a Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender centre the
following day; or for threats made in 2013
against women human rights defenders
for supporting the law on reparations for
rape survivors. An outbreak of the Ebola virus disease killed
at least 2,758 people. A state of emergency
was declared. Thousands suspected of
committing crimes during the 11-year
armed conflict in Sierra Leone have still not
been investigated. At least two complaints
of unlawful killings by the police occurred.
The increased use of criminal defamation
against journalists threatened freedom
of expression.
Discrimination – Roma In 2013, President Koroma launched

BACKGROUND
Amnesty International Report 2014/15programmes and engagement regarding
the review. However, these were delayed by
the Ebola outbreak. International assistance
was inadequate, although there was some
improvement later in the year.
EBOLA OUTBREAK
Sierra Leone was severely affected by the
Ebola epidemic that spread across West
Africa. By 31 December 2014 there were
9,446 confirmed cases and at least 2,758
people had died. The epidemic weakened
fragile health care systems and more than
199 health workers were infected by 31
October. NGOs expressed concerns regarding
food security, the disproportionate impact
on women and the treatment of people in
quarantine. In July 2014, the President
declared a state of emergency and passed
the Public Emergency Regulations 2014.
By-laws for the Prevention of Ebola and Other
Diseases were also passed by the Ministry
of Local Government, including a ban on
public gatherings.
DEATH PENALTY
Sierra Leone retained the death penalty
for treason and aggravated robbery, and it
remained mandatory for murder. In May, the
Attorney General and Minister of Justice told
the UN Committee against Torture that Sierra
Leone will shortly abolish the death penalty
and later clarified that it would be done
through a revision of the Criminal Procedure
Act. No further action had been taken by the
end of the year.
ARBITRARY DETENTIONS
People were regularly detained beyond
constitutional time limits by the police. In
August 2013, 18 members of the Republic
of Sierra Leone Armed Forces were detained
for allegedly plotting to mutiny at the Tekoh
barracks in Makeni. They were held in
incommunicado detention for eight months,
in violation of constitutional detention time
limits. Fourteen of them were indicted and
brought to trial, which was ongoing at the end
of the year.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
In 2013, the Special Court for Sierra Leone
upheld the 50-year prison sentence of former
Liberian President Charles Taylor for his role
in Sierra Leone’s armed conflict, completing
the court’s mandate to try those bearing the
greatest responsibility for crimes committed
during the conflict. However, thousands
suspected of committing crimes during the
conflict have not been investigated and
brought to justice. The issue of accountability
for human rights violations was highlighted
when the UN Panel of Experts on Liberia
uncovered the presence of alleged arms
dealer Ibrahim Bah, a Senegalese national, in
Sierra Leone in 2013. A private prosecution
was brought against him by victims of
the conflict supported by a civil society
organization, the Centre for Accountability
and Rule of Law. Sierra Leone deported
Ibrahim Bah to Senegal days before he was
due to appear in court. The government took steps to strengthen
accountability for the Sierra Leone
Police (SLP). The police instituted a new
performance management system in 2013
and parliament approved regulations to
establish an Independent Police Complaints
Board. However, the government failed to
investigate and hold accountable police
officers accused of using arbitrary or
excessive force. The government has not
prosecuted any police officers, despite the
recommendation of independent inquiries
conducted into incidents of alleged unlawful
killings. There were at least two allegations
of unlawful killings by the police in 2014,
connected to police shootings in Kono in
response to a riot relating to a suspected
Ebola case.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The justice system still suffers from a lack
of resources with constant adjournments,
323indictment delays and a shortage of
magistrates, contributing to lengthy pre-trial
detention and prison overcrowding. Positive
steps were taken to implement the Legal Aid
Act, passed in 2013, but the Legal Aid Board
is not yet operational. Steps were also taken
to redraft the Criminal Procedure Act 1965.
The Corrections Act was passed in 2014,
reforming the 1960 Prison Rules, with a
greater focus on prisoner rehabilitation.
In March 2014, the UN Human Rights
Committee reviewed Sierra Leone’s
implementation of the ICCPR. It expressed
concerns regarding several issues such as
trial delays, prison conditions and police
accountability.
WOMEN’S AND GIRLS’ RIGHTS
Sexual and gender-based violence remained a
disturbingly frequent occurrence. The Sexual
Offences Act 2012 introduced improved
definitions of, and stiffer penalties for, sexual
violence. However, more work is needed to
implement the provisions.
In September 2013 the Deputy Minister
of Education, Science and Technology was
fired following allegations of sexual assault
and rape. During the trial, the media revealed
the alleged victim’s name, in contravention
of both the 2012 Act and the Media Code of
Practice. The presiding magistrate accepted
an application for protective measures to
be applied and subsequent witnesses were
allowed to testify behind a screen. The
Independent Media Commission publicly
condemned specific media houses and is
investigating complaints brought against
them. The criminal case is still being heard.
The Gender Equality Bill, which provides
for a minimum 30% representation of women
in Parliament, local councils and ministries,
departments and agencies, was not enacted.
Sierra Leone has yet to ratify the Maputo
Protocol (the Protocol to the African Charter
on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights
of Women in Africa). It is the only country
in West Africa yet to do so. The Minister of
Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs
324
made assurances in 2014 that steps would
be taken towards ratification.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The increased use of criminal defamation
against journalists threatened freedom of
expression. In July 2013 Jonathan Leigh,
managing editor of the Independent Observer
newspaper, was charged with four counts of
defamatory libel after publishing an article
accusing a businessman of corrupt and
fraudulent behaviour. The case was eventually
resolved out of court.
In October 2013 Leigh and Bai Bai Sesay
from the Independent Observer were charged
with criminal defamation for publishing an
article criticizing the President. The journalists
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to publish a
seditious article. They were cautioned and
discharged in March 2014.
The Human Rights Commission of Sierra
Leone, the Sierra Leone Association of
Journalists and various civil society groups
recommended the repeal of the country’s
criminal libel law.
In January 2014 David Tam Baryoh was
arrested for seditious libel and released on
bail. In May his radio programme Monologue
was banned for two months following a
government directive. He was arrested again
in November for comments made on his
programme regarding the government’s
response to the Ebola outbreak. He was
detained for 11 days and released on bail.
In October 2013 the Right to Access
Information Act was passed. It established a
right to access government information and
requires all parts of government to adopt
and widely disseminate a plan for making
records publicly available. The legislation also
imposed a penalty for wilful obstruction of
its provisions.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
The UN Human Rights Committee expressed
concern about reported violence against
members of the LGBTI community and called
Amnesty International Report 2014/15on Sierra Leone to review its legislation to
ensure that discrimination against the LGBTI
community is prohibited.
Three LGBTI activists were assaulted, sent
threatening messages and one of their homes
was repeatedly broken into in 2013. Despite
reporting these incidents to the police,
no credible investigations were initiated.
The harassment forced the activists to flee
Sierra Leone and they were granted asylum
in Europe.
SINGAPORE
Republic of Singapore
Head of state: Tony Tan Keng Yam
Head of government: Lee Hsien Loong
Human rights defenders and small
opposition parties called for broader human
rights change through public gatherings,
online activities and constitutional
challenges. The People’s Action Party
remained in power for a sixth decade.
DEATH PENALTY
The execution of one death row prisoner was
stayed in March, but Singapore broke its
three-year moratorium on executions in July
when two men were hanged – a mandatory
death sentence had been imposed under
the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) prior to the
November 2012 amendments abolishing
some instances in which murder and drug
trafficking carry a mandatory death penalty.
Commutations of death sentences to life
imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane
continued, following the November 2012
legislative amendments. Some of those whose
sentences were commuted had been judged
as having “diminished responsibility” and
others had aided anti-drug trafficking efforts
and obtained “certificates of cooperation”.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In July, parliament amended the Radiation
Protection Act to allow for the imposition of
the death penalty for nuclear-related offences
with an intent to harm and that cause
fatalities. There were no nuclear facilities
in Singapore.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Caning remained a penalty for various
offences, including immigration violations,
vandalism and as an alternative (with
life imprisonment) to the death penalty.
In August, Yong Vui Kong, whose death
sentence had been commuted to life
imprisonment and caning, challenged his
penalty of 15 strokes on the grounds that the
Constitution prohibited torture. The Court of
Appeal judgment was pending at the end of
the year, but the Attorney-General took the
position that caning did not amount to torture
and that torture is not prohibited by the
Constitution.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Opposition activists, former prisoners of
conscience and human rights defenders
expressed concerns about the shrinking
space for public discussion of issues such
as freedom of expression, the death penalty,
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex rights, labour rights, poverty and
inadequate living standards.
The government persisted in using
defamation suits against critics. In May the
Prime Minister sued blogger Roy Ngerng
Yi Leng for defamation after Ngerng was
alleged to have accused the Prime Minister
of "criminal misappropriation" of public
retirement funds in his blog. Despite a
retraction and a public apology, as well as an
offer of damages, the Prime Minister called
for a summary judgment on the case in July.
Ngerng was dismissed from his job with a
public hospital in June. In view of financially
ruinous outcomes from previous suits against
critics, Ngerng turned to crowdfunding to
finance his legal defence.
325DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL
Around 12 suspected Islamist militants
remained held without trial under the Internal
Security Act.
SLOVAKIA
Slovak Republic
Head of state: Andrej Kiska (replaced Ivan
Gašparovič in June)
Head of government: Robert Fico
Roma children continued to face
discrimination in the education system.
The authorities extradited an asylum-seeker
to the Russian Federation despite the risk
of torture and other ill-treatment upon
return. A referendum on proposals, which
would block further rights for same-sex
partnerships, was declared constitutional.
In November, two detainees from the
detention facility at Guantánamo Bay were
transferred to Slovakia for resettlement.
Slovakia had not ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on preventing and
combating violence against women and
domestic violence.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
In June, during the UN Universal Periodic
Review (UPR), Slovakia restated its
commitment to tackling the issue of large
numbers of Roma children in schools for
children with mental disabilities. However,
in July the Slovak Public Defender of Rights
noted that Slovakia continued to violate
Roma children’s right to education through
discriminatory diagnostic procedures.
The Ministry of Education persisted with
plans developed together with the Office of
the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the
Slovak Republic for Roma communities to
construct “modular schools” ostensibly with
the aim of increasing access to education.
326
The Ministry planned to construct 15 such
schools over the course of the year, several of
them in Roma settlements. In May, however,
the Plenipotentiary acknowledged that the
project could result in increased segregation
in education.
As part of the UPR, Slovakia acknowledged
the need for measures to legalize informal
Roma settlements. The Ministry of Transport
and Construction developed proposals for a
new Construction Act to address the issue
of “illegal constructions”, including informal
Roma settlements. In July, the OSCE Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights expressed concern that the proposals
lacked safeguards to protect residents of
unauthorized buildings from forced evictions.
It emphasized that eviction decisions should
be subject to judicial review and that affected
residents had to have access to remedies and
compensation.
Police violence
In January, the Inspection of the Ministry
of Interior initiated a criminal investigation
into the excessive use of force during a
police operation in the Roma settlement
of Budulovská in the town of Moldava nad
Bodvou on 19 June 2013. Earlier complaints
by affected residents had been dismissed.
The police operation was criticized by the
Public Defender of Rights for having used
excessive force, derogatory treatment and
arbitrary searches.
At the end of the year, the trial of police
officers, accused of the ill-treatment of six
Roma boys at a police station in 2009 in the
city of Košice, was still pending before the
district court. In March, one of the police
officers, who was dismissed following the
allegations of ill-treatment, was reinstated.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
On 4 June, the National Council (Parliament)
adopted a constitutional amendment which
defined marriage as “a unique union between
a man and a woman”. The amendment
explicitly excluded same-sex couples from
Amnesty International Report 2014/15entering a marriage. 1 It came into force on
1 September.
In August, the organization “Alliance
for Family” delivered a petition signed by
400,000 people to the President demanding
a referendum that would ban any other
form of partnership than a union between
a man and a woman from being defined
as “marriage”. They also demanded to ban
adoptions by same-sex couples, to deny
legal recognition to any kind of partnership
other than a “marriage between one man
and one woman” and to prevent schools
from providing mandatory sexuality education
or information on ethical issues such as
euthanasia, if the pupil or parent did not
consent to such classes. In September, the
President requested the Constitutional Court
to review the constitutionality of a referendum
on the issues raised by the petition. The Court
ruled in October, that, with the exception
of the question on the legal recognition of
different forms of “partnership”, all the other
questions were constitutional. In November,
the President set the date for the referendum
for February 2015.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Slovakia continued to return individuals to
countries where they would risk torture and
other ill-treatment.
In July, Slovakia extradited Anzor Chentiev,
an ethnic Chechen, to the Russian Federation
where he was wanted in connection with
various terrorism-related offences. Anzor
Chentiev had been fighting against extradition
for nine years. The Ministry of Justice
approved the extradition despite the risk that
he would be subjected to torture or other
ill-treatment on his return and the fact that
Anzor Chentiev had reapplied for asylum in
Slovakia on 3 June. 2
In August, the Supreme Court rejected
Aslan Yandiev’s appeal against the decision
of the Regional Court in Trnava allowing
his extradition to the Russian Federation,
where he was accused of membership of an
armed group. The Court was satisfied that
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
the assurances provided by the Prosecutor
General of the Russian Federation in
February 2011 were “specific and reliable”.
His extradition had previously been blocked
by the European Court of Human Rights as
well as the Slovak Constitutional Court on the
grounds that it would expose Aslan Yandiev
to the risk of torture and other ill-treatment
and that his asylum application in Slovakia
was pending.

SLOVENIA
Republic of Slovenia
Head of state: Borut Pahor
Head of government: Miro Cerar (replaced Alenka
Bratušek in September)
The authorities failed to restore the status
of people whose permanent residency was
unlawfully revoked in 1992 or provide
them with adequate compensation,
perpetuating the longstanding violation of
their rights. Discrimination against Roma
remained widespread.
DISCRIMINATION – THE “ERASED”
Despite some positive measures, the
authorities failed to guarantee the rights of
some former permanent residents of Slovenia
originating from other former Yugoslav
republics, known as the “erased”, whose legal
status was unlawfully revoked in 1992.
The 2010 Legal Status Act, which offered
an avenue for the erased to restore their
327legal status, expired in July 2013. About
12,000 of the 25,671 “erased” had had their
status restored by this date. In December
2013, legislation was adopted creating a
compensation scheme for those whose
status had been regulated. The scheme
provided €50 for each month spent without
legal status.
On 12 March 2014 the European Court
of Human Rights, in Kurić and Others
v. Slovenia, ordered Slovenia to pay the
applicants between €30,000 and €70,000 for
pecuniary damages. The judgment followed
a ruling by the Grand Chamber in 2012,
which established that the right to respect for
private and family life, the right to effective
legal remedy and the right to be free from
discrimination had been violated, and ordered
the payment of non-pecuniary damages also.
These sums were far greater than the sums
payable to recipients of compensation under
the December 2013 scheme.
DISCRIMINATION – ROMA
Despite a number of initiatives in recent years
to improve the situation of the approximately
10,000 Roma in Slovenia, the majority
continued to face discrimination and social
exclusion. Most lived in isolated, segregated
settlements, lacking security of tenure and
access to basic services such as water,
electricity, sanitation and public transport.
Widespread discrimination prevented Roma
families from buying or renting housing
outside of mainly Roma-populated areas,
and they continued to face obstacles,
including prejudice, in accessing social
housing. Discrimination against Roma in the
labour market remained commonplace and
unemployment levels among Roma were
extremely high.
State institutions created to combat and
consider complaints of discrimination, such
as the Human Rights Ombudsman and
the Advocate of the Principle of Equality,
had weak mandates and remained poorly
resourced. The office of the Advocate of the
328
Principle of Equality had just one employee:
the Advocate himself.
Throughout the year approximately 250
Roma living in the Škocjan-Dobruška vas
settlement remained at risk of forced eviction.
The settlement, part of which was designated
for the development of an industrial zone in
2013, had been home to the Roma families
for many years. Following public pressure
and the intervention of the national authorities
and Roma civil society, the municipality
agreed in August 2014 to relocate two Roma
families at imminent risk of forced eviction as
development work commenced. However, no
further plans were consulted with residents
who remained at risk of losing their homes.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The trial of journalist Anuška Delić for
publishing classified information began in
October and was ongoing by the end of the
year. The charges related to articles she
published alleging links between members of
the Slovenian Democratic Party and the far-
right group Blood and Honour. The Slovenian
Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA)
claimed subsequently that some of the
information in her reports had been leaked
from its files. The Slovenian criminal code
does not provide for a public interest defence.
SOMALIA
Federal Republic of Somalia
Head of state: Hassan Sheikh Mohamud
Head of government: Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed
Head of Somaliland Republic: Ahmed Mohamed
Mahamoud Silyano
Armed conflict continued between pro-
government forces, the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and
the Islamist armed group al-Shabaab
in southern and central Somalia. Pro-
Amnesty International Report 2014/15government forces continued an offensive
to take control of key towns. Over a hundred
thousand civilians were killed, injured or
displaced by armed conflict and generalized
violence during the year. All parties to
the conflict were responsible for serious
violations of human rights and humanitarian
law, including AMISOM. Armed groups
continued to forcibly recruit people,
including children, and to abduct, torture
and unlawfully kill people; rape and other
forms of sexual violence were widespread.
Aid agencies’ access remained constrained
by fighting, insecurity and restrictions
imposed by parties to the conflict.
Journalists and media workers were attacked
and harassed. One journalist was killed.
Perpetrators of serious human rights abuses
continued to enjoy impunity.
BACKGROUND
The Somali Federal Government (SFG)
and AMISOM remained in control of the
capital, Mogadishu. A joint offensive by the
Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF) and
AMISOM sought to flush out al-Shabaab
operatives from areas of south and central
Somalia with some success. However,
al-Shabaab maintained control of much of
south and central Somalia. Armed clashes
and al-Shabaab attacks against civilians
increased, particularly in contested areas.
Increased abuses of international law were
witnessed throughout the course of the
offensive, allegedly caused by all parties to
the conflict.
The partial lifting of the arms embargo
on Somalia in 2013 appeared to contribute
to abuses against civilians into 2014.
In February, the UN Monitoring Group
highlighted continuous violations of Somalia’s
arms embargoes, reporting the diversion of
arms intended for use by non-government
armed forces, including al-Shabaab.
International support for government security
forces, allied militias and AMISOM continued,
despite lack of accountability for ongoing,
serious human rights abuses.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Somalia’s humanitarian situation
deteriorated rapidly due to the ongoing
conflict, drought and reduced humanitarian
access with conditions as bad or worse than
before the 2011 famine. A s of September, a
bout 42% of the population were in crisis or
needed assistance.
Somalia faced political crisis, too. Prime
Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid resigned
in December 2013 following a parliamentary
vote of no confidence. In January a new,
larger C abinet was appointed consisting
of 25 ministers, with two council members
retained from the previous administration.
In May, MPs called for President Mohamud
to resign. In November, following clashes
between President Hassan and the incoming
Prime Minister, a proposal for a second
parliamentary vote of no confidence against
the Prime Minister was put on hold due to
the possibility of violence between opposing
members of parliament. Plans for revising
and implementing the constitution and
the proposed federalization plan remained
pending, leading to increases in clan-based
conflict and abuses.
In June 2013, the UN Assistance Mission
in Somalia (UNSOM) was established, which
included a human rights monitoring and
reporting mandate.
In September, a US drone strike
killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader
of al-Shabaab. Internal divisions within
al-Shabaab during 2013 had resulted in
scores of deaths and the execution of key
leaders of the movement, allowing Godane
to consolidate his power. A new leader and
known hardliner, ‘Abu Ubaidah’, was quickly
announced. Retaliatory attacks took place,
including a suicide attack a week after
Godane’s death, which killed at least 12
people, including four Americans.
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Indiscriminate attacks
Civilians continued to be killed and wounded
indiscriminately in crossfire during armed
clashes; in suicide attacks and in attacks
329involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
and grenades. 2014 saw an increase in such
attacks as well as on high profile targets.
Al-Shabaab retained the ability to stage lethal
attacks in the most heavily guarded parts
of Mogadishu, killing or injuring hundreds
of civilians. Two deadly attacks took place
at Villa Somalia during the year, following a
number of such attacks in 2013. In August, a
complex attack was carried out on a national
security detention facility, killing two civilians.
At least 10 people were killed in an attack on
parliament in May. Government and AMISOM
offensives led to increases in abuses by all
parties to the conflict. Air strikes continued to
be carried out.
Direct targeting of civilians
Civilians remained at risk of targeted attacks
and killings in Mogadishu. During Ramadan
in July, recorded assassination attempts
reached their highest level since al-Shabaab
lost control of most parts of Mogadishu in
2010. On 27 July, a businessman was shot
and killed by unknown armed men in his
shop in Bakara market. On 23 September, a
woman was shot and killed in Heliwa district.
She had worked as a cook for SNAF forces
in Mogadishu.
Al-Shabaab factions continued to torture
and unlawfully kill people they accused
of spying or not conforming to their strict
interpretation of Islamic law. They killed
people in public, including by stoning, and
carried out amputations and floggings. They
continued to impose restrictive behavioural
codes on women and men. On 27 September,
a woman was allegedly stoned to death
in Barawe, a town in Lower Shabelle,
on suspicion of marrying more than one
husband. She was reportedly buried up to
her neck and stoned to death by hooded men
in front of a crowd. On 2 June, according
to reports, al-Shabaab executed three men
accused of being spies for the SFG and the
Kenyan and US governments. The men were
executed by firing squad in a park in Barawe
in front of a gathering of several hundred
people. 1
330
Unlawful killings, extortion, arbitrary
arrests and rape continued to be carried out
by government forces and aligned militia,
in part as a result of poor discipline and
lack of command control. On 25 August,
an SNAF soldier reportedly shot and killed
a minibus driver in Afar-Irdood area, Xamar
Weyne District, after the driver refused to pay
extortion money.
CHILD SOLDIERS
Children continued to suffer grave abuses by
all parties to the armed conflict. Al-Shabaab
continued to target children for recruitment
and forced marriage, and attacked schools.
Government-affiliated militias were again
accused of recruiting and using child soldiers.
Implementation of the two action plans
signed by the government in 2012 to end
and prevent the recruitment and use of child
soldiers, as well as the killing and maiming
of children, was outstanding and children
remained in the armed forces. The Minister
of Defence and Minister of National Security
signed standard operating procedures for
handling children formerly associated with
armed groups.
The SFG had not ratified the Convention
on the Rights of the Child and its Optional
Protocols by the end of the year, despite its
commitments to ratify the conventions.
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE,
ASYLUM-SEEKERS AND REFUGEES
Over 1 million people in Somalia were in
crisis and an additional 2.1 million people
were in need of assistance. For the first
time since the 2011 famine, food security
began deteriorating rapidly. Insecurity and
fighting reportedly caused over 60% of new
displacement in 2014. Trade routes were
heavily disrupted due to the SNAF and
AMISOM military offensives; al-Shabaab
blocked supply routes, causing major
disruption to the work of humanitarian
organizations trying to access towns. This
led to sharp increases in food prices. These
Amnesty International Report 2014/15issues combined placed Somalia at significant
risk of sliding back into a state of emergency.
In Mogadishu, tens of thousands of people
were forcibly evicted from government and
private property. Many of them moved to the
outskirts of Mogadishu, including the Afgooye
corridor, where there was little security
provision or access to services. There were
reports of increases in rape and other forms
of sexual violence against women and girls in
these areas. An IDP policy framework drafted
in April was not adopted.
There were over 900,000 Somali refugees
in the region, particularly in Ethiopia and
Kenya. Plans by the Kenyan authorities to
return Somalis continued despite serious
human rights violations, including the
forced return of 359 people and forcible
encampment of thousands of others. Other
states hosting Somali asylum-seekers and
refugees, including some EU states, began
attempts to return failed Somali asylum-
seekers to Mogadishu on the grounds that
they no longer needed protection due to an
apparent improvement in security there.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
– JOURNALISTS
Somali journalists and media workers
continued to be attacked, harassed and
intimidated. On 21 June, Yusuf Ahmed
Abukar was killed on his way to work when
a bomb attached to his car exploded. Yusuf
reported for the privately owned Mustaqbal
radio station, in Mogadishu and a Nairobi-
based radio station, Ergo. The Prime Minister
stated that the attack was being investigated,
however Amnesty International was not aware
of any progress in the case by year’s end.
Media freedom continued to be curtailed,
journalists were arrested and media houses
closed down. In August, broadcasters
Radio Shabelle and Sky FM were closed
down and 19 of their journalists and media
workers arrested, including Abdimaalik Yusuf
Mohamoud, the owner of Radio Shabelle,
and Mohamud Mohamed Dahir, the director
of Sky FM. On 21 October, Abdimaalik Yusuf
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Mohamoud and Shabelle newscaster Ahmed
Abdia Hassan were brought before the court
on two charges relating to incitement to
disturbance of public order and to commit
offences. Both rejected the charges and
were released on bail, while Shabelle’s Editor
Mohamed Bashir Hashi and Mohamud
Mohamed Dahir were not brought to the
hearing. In June, a restrictive media bill was
submitted to Cabinet proposing to curtail
media rights. In September, the National
Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA)
issued a ban on national media coverage of
all al-Shabaab activities. Al-Shabaab imposed
severe restrictions on media freedom and
banned the internet in areas under its control.
Little progress was made in addressing
impunity for the murder of journalists, despite
a government taskforce established for that
purpose in 2012. People suspected of killing
journalists continued to enjoy impunity. Of
more than twenty journalists murdered since
2005, only two prosecutions had resulted
in convictions by the end of the year. In
March 2013, a military court convicted
Adan Sheikh Abdi Sheikha Hussein for the
murder of Hassan Yusuf Absuge in 2012, and
sentenced him to death in a trial that did not
meet due process standards. A firing squad
executed Adan in August 2013.
DEATH PENALTY
Somalia continued to use the death penalty
despite its support for the 2012 UN General
Assembly resolution on the moratorium of the
death penalty. Many executions were carried
out by the military court, often involving
members of Somali armed opposition groups
such as al-Shabaab, government soldiers and
people convicted of murder.
Executions were often carried out rapidly,
after proceedings falling short of international
fair trial standards, while there was an
apparent spike in executions throughout the
year. On 3 April, a man was executed by
firing squad in Kismayo nine days after he
allegedly murdered an elder. It was unclear
which, if any, court found had him guilty. On
33130 July, Somalia’s military court sentenced
three men to death for alleged membership
of al-Shabaab. Four days later, pictures were
circulated on twitter allegedly showing their
bodies. On 30 August, Somalia’s military
court found alleged al-Shabaab members Ali
Bashir Osman and Abdulahi Sharif Osman
guilty of killing the journalist Timacade in
2013 and sentenced them to death. The two
men were executed on 26 October by public
firing squad.
1. Forced returns to south and central Somalia, including to al-Shabaab
nine provinces, but with a reduced national
majority of 62.15%. A new political party,
the Economic Freedom Fighters, gained
6.35% of the vote and with the established
opposition Democratic Alliance increased
pressure on the ANC government in the
national parliament for greater transparency
and accountability.
Access to anti-retroviral treatment
for people living with HIV continued to
expand, with 2.5 million South Africans on
treatment according to official figures at July
2014. As a result, life expectancy in South
Africa increased.

SOUTH AFRICA
Republic of South Africa
Head of state and government: Jacob G. Zuma
Judicial commissions of inquiry highlighted
police use of excessive force, including
unlawful killings, and failures in delivery
of services to poor communities. Incidents
of property destruction and displacement
of refugees and asylum-seekers continued
to occur. Access to treatment for people
living with HIV continued to expand and
HIV treatment interventions for pregnant
women contributed to a decline in maternal
deaths. However, key discriminatory
barriers continued to delay women and
girls' access to antenatal care. Progress was
made in addressing hate crimes based on
the victims’ sexual orientation or gender
identity. Human rights defenders faced
intimidation and threats.
BACKGROUND
Following the general elections in May the
ruling African National Congress (ANC) party
was returned to power in eight out of the
332
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
The Marikana Commission of Inquiry into the
fatal police shootings of 34 striking platinum
mine workers at Marikana in August 2012
ended its public hearings on 14 November.
Closing arguments were heard from legal
parties representing the police, mining
unions, LONMIN plc, the families of the 34
striking mine workers killed by police and
the families of seven other people – three
non-striking workers, two police officers
and two LONMIN security guards – who
were killed during the developing conflict.
The Commissioners were due to report
their conclusions and recommendations to
President Zuma in 2015.
There were indications that the police
attempted to conceal and destroy evidence
and to fabricate a version of events intended
to mislead the official inquiry from the start.
A crucial meeting held by police officials on
the evening of 15 August 2012 endorsed
the decision to forcibly disarm, disperse and
arrest the striking mine workers by the end
of the following day. Senior police officials,
most particularly the National Commissioner
of Police, persistently failed to co-operate
with the Commission’s inquiries about the
meeting. The decision to disarm the striking
miners was taken despite the anticipation of
loss of life and injury. It led to the deployment
of “tactical units” armed with lethal force, the
firing of over 600 rounds of live ammunition
Amnesty International Report 2014/15by police at two separate locations, and to
34 deaths. The fatal injuries were nearly all
sustained to the head or upper body. 1
Other evidence before the Commission
indicated that those involved in the decision
failed to plan for adequate emergency
medical assistance to be available.
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
Evidence before the Marikana Commission
on labour relations and socioeconomic
conditions underlying the August 2012 strike
was curtailed due to pressure to complete the
Commission’s work. However, LONMIN was
scrutinized in the final months, in respect
of its failures to take adequate measures
to protect the lives of its security staff
and employees, and its failure to fulfil the
company’s socioeconomic obligations linked
to its mining lease in Marikana.
On 20 August, the state withdrew all
charges, including possession of dangerous
weapons and involvement in an illegal
gathering, against 270 strikers arrested at
the scene of the police shootings on 16
August 2012.
EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS
The start of the trial of 27 police officers, the
majority of whom are members of the Cato
Manor Organized Crime Unit (CMU), on 28
counts of murder and other charges, was
further delayed following their appearance
in the Durban High Court on 23 June, and
postponed until February 2015. The police
officers faced criminal charges in connection
with, among others, the death of Bongani
Mkhize. In May, the Pietermaritzburg High
Court ruled that the Minister of Police was
liable to pay damages to the family of Bongani
Mkhize, who had been killed by members of
the CMU and the National Intervention Unit in
February 2009.
In February 2014, the High Court had ruled
that the decisions taken by the then National
Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) to
prosecute the former CMU commander Johan
Booysen on seven charges of racketeering
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
under the Prevention of Organized Crime
Act was arbitrary and offended the principle
of legality. While ruling that the decisions to
prosecute charges under the Act should be
set aside, High Court judge Trevor Gorven
emphasized that the ruling did not preclude
the NDPP from reinstituting the charges on a
proper basis in future.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Allegations of torture against members of the
South African Police Service (SAPS) and the
Department of Correctional Services were
rife. Towards the end of the year the SAPS
Legal Services issued a National Instruction
to all SAPS members informing them of
the absolute prohibition of torture and their
obligations under the 2013 Prevention and
Combating of Torture of Persons Act.
On 30 October, the Constitutional Court
dismissed the appeal brought by the SAPS
National Commissioner who had refused to
investigate complaints of torture contained
in a 2008 “dossier” by the Zimbabwe Exiles’
Forum and the Southern African Human
Rights Litigation Centre. The Constitutional
Court concluded that the SAPS had both the
power and the duty to investigate the alleged
complaints, which amounted to crimes
against humanity.
DEATH PENALTY
In September the North Gauteng High Court
ruled that the deportation to Botswana of
Edwin Samotse, a Botswana national, by
Department of Home Affairs (DHA) officials
was unlawful and unconstitutional. Edwin
Samotse faced criminal charges in Botswana
for which the death sentence was applicable.
The South African authorities had not
obtained the requisite undertaking from the
Botswana authorities to ensure that the death
sentence would not be imposed. The Court
ordered the DHA to implement measures to
prevent a recurrence of similar deportations.
333REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
During the year there were numerous
incidents involving threats and violence
against refugees, asylum-seekers and
migrants, with looting or destruction of
hundreds of their small businesses and
homes. In the first four months of the year
incidents in seven provinces led to the
displacement of over 1,600 people. In
June, sustained attacks in the Mamelodi
area near Pretoria and the slow response of
the police led to the looting or destruction
of some 76 Somali-owned shops, large-
scale displacements, the death of one
refugee and injuries to 10 others. 2 There
was continuing concern at the failure of the
government to protect the life and physical
integrity of refugees and others in need of
international protection.
In September, the Supreme Court of
Appeal (SCA) overturned a High Court
ruling which had allowed in effect the forced
closure of refugee-operated small businesses
by police and municipal authorities under
what was known as Operation Hard Stick.
These closures had been accompanied by
ill-treatment, abuses, displacement and
destitution. The SCA ruled that both formally
recognized refugees and asylum-seekers
were entitled to apply for trading licences,
particularly where the latter faced long delays
in the final determination of their application
for asylum.
In November, charges were withdrawn in
the North Gauteng High Court against 15 of
the 20 Congolese men who had been on trial
on charges of contravening South Africa’s
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance
Act. They had also faced a second charge,
conspiracy to commit murder, with the
alleged targets including the President
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), Joseph Kabila, and military and other
government officials. Five defendants, all
originally from the DRC, remained on trial
in the High Court on the same charges,
with the trial due to resume in January
2015. All 20, when arrested in February
334
2013, were remanded in prison in Pretoria
until the trial began 17 months later. The
presiding judge ordered an investigation into
allegations by the accused of ill-treatment,
including prolonged periods of isolation in
remand prison.
MATERNAL HEALTH AND HIV
HIV-infection continued to be the main
cause of death of women and girls during
pregnancy and shortly after birth, accounting
for over 40% of deaths. Government data
reported that 60% of all maternal deaths
were potentially avoidable. HIV prevalence
rates nationally for pregnant women of 29.5%
remained a serious concern, with health
districts in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal
provinces showing rates of over 40%. New
national figures published in 2014 reported
that almost a quarter of all new HIV infections
were occurring in girls and young women
between 15 and 24 years.
In July, the Health Minister expressed
concern that girls under 18 years of age
accounted for 7.8% of all live births but 36%
of maternal deaths. Department of Health
figures indicated that the maternal mortality
ratio had declined from 310 to 269 maternal
deaths for every 100,000 live births.
In July, the government announced that
access to free and lifelong anti-retroviral
treatment would be available for all pregnant
women living with HIV from January 2015. In
August, the government launched a mobile
phone messaging service, “Mom Connect”,
to provide pregnant women and girls with
information during pregnancy.
However, barriers to accessing maternal
health services continued. Pregnant women
and girls accessed antenatal care late in their
pregnancies and such delays were linked
to nearly a quarter of avoidable maternal
deaths in South Africa. Women and girls
said that they delayed accessing antenatal
care in part because of concerns that health
facilities did not ensure confidentiality and
informed consent, particularly in relation
to implementation of HIV testing. They
Amnesty International Report 2014/15also cited a lack of access to information,
negative attitudes by health care workers
and unreliable or costly transport to health
facilities as barriers to early access. Poverty
was an exacerbating factor. 3
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Discriminatory violence against LGBTI people
continued to cause concern and fear. In
2013 and 2014, at least five people, three of
them lesbian women, were murdered in what
appeared to be targeted violence related to
their sexual orientation or gender identity.
There was some progress made in
addressing hate crimes through the revival
of the National Task Team process and
establishment of a Rapid Response Team
by Department of Justice and Constitutional
Development officials, Constitutional
Development officials, and others. In
February, the Rapid Response Team
reported progress in 19 out of 43 previously
“unresolved” cases identified as suspected
anti-LGBTI violence.
Civil society representatives and
Department of Justice officials also held
discussions on a draft hate crimes policy
document, intended to assist the drafting
of legislation on hate crimes. There was no
further progress with the legislation by the
end of the year.
In November, the Johannesburg High Court
convicted a man of the rape and murder in
2013 of a lesbian woman, Duduzile Zozo.
Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela issued a strong
condemnation of the discriminatory attitudes
which fuelled such crimes. 4
At the end of the year, preliminary trial
proceedings had begun against a suspect
charged with the murder of 21-year-old David
Olyn, who was beaten and burned to death
in March, apparently because of his sexual
orientation. However, civil society monitors
expressed concern at limitations in the police
investigation.
South Africa supported the adoption in May
of Resolution 275 by the African Commission
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
on Human and Peoples’ Rights, urging states
to end all acts of violence and abuse because
of real or perceived sexual orientation or
gender identity.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Harassment of human rights defenders
and organizations, and improper pressure
on institutions, including oversight bodies,
remained a major concern. The Office of
the Public Protector and its Director, Thuli
Madonsela, faced sustained pressure
amounting to intimidation by members of the
government in connection with the oversight
body’s investigation and report on the
improper use of public funds by the President
at his home in KwaZulu-Natal Province.
At the end of the year, criminal trial
proceedings had not concluded against
a Social Justice Coalition (SJC) founder
member, Angy Peter, and three others. The
SJC, including Angy Peter, had gathered
evidence in 2012 to support a call for a
commission of inquiry into police corruption
and their failure to provide proper services
to the poor community of Khayelitsha. The
judicial Commission of Inquiry, which was
established in August 2012, finally began
its hearings in February 2014, and issued
its report in August. The hearings had been
delayed for over a year until the Constitutional
Court ruled finally in 2013 against the
then Minister of Police and the National
Commissioner of Police who had opposed
its establishment. The Commission’s report
confirmed many of the concerns documented
by SJC.
Health rights activists came under
increasing pressure, particularly in Free State
province. Members of the Treatment Action
Campaign (TAC) were reportedly threatened
and intimidated by ANC ruling party
provincial officials and anonymous callers
because of their work for people living with
HIV and against corruption. Sello Mokhalipi,
then Free State Provincial Chairperson of
TAC, temporarily went into hiding and later
lodged criminal charges with the police in
335early 2014, following alleged death threats.
TAC Free State Provincial Co-ordinator,
Machobane Morake, was also allegedly
subjected to threats and intimidation. In
July, the two men and a third TAC colleague
were alleged victims of an attempted night
ambush on a remote road. At the time, they
were supporting 127 Free State community
health workers and TAC activists who had
been arrested during a peaceful vigil at
the offices of the Free State Department of
Health. Those arrested were held in police
stations in Bloemfontein for 36 hours before
appearing in court where they were charged
with participating in an illegal gathering. After
two further remand hearings, their case was
postponed to January 2015.

SOUTH SUDAN
Republic of South Sudan
Head of state and government: Salva Kiir Mayardit
The internal armed conflict that erupted in
South Sudan in December 2013 resulted
in tens of thousands of deaths and the
destruction of entire towns. Approximately
1.4 million people were internally displaced
and another 500,000 fled to neighbouring
336
countries. An estimated 4 million people
were at a high risk of food insecurity,
with the UN repeatedly warning of a
deepening humanitarian crisis and potential
famine should fighting continue. Despite
a cessation of hostilities agreement in
January 2014 and continuous efforts by the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) to negotiate a political solution to
the conflict, fighting continued throughout
2014. The conflict was characterized by
a total disregard for international human
rights and humanitarian law and there was
no accountability for abuses committed in
the context of the conflict.
BACKGROUND
On 15 December 2013, a political dispute
within South Sudan’s ruling party, the Sudan
People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM),
escalated into an armed confrontation in
Juba between forces loyal to President Kiir
and those loyal to former Vice-President
Riek Machar. By the end of 2013, violence
had spread to Jonglei, Unity and Upper
Nile states.
IGAD, an eight-country East African
regional organization, began mediating
between the government of South Sudan
and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/
Movement in Opposition (SPLA/M-IO) in
January 2014. The parties signed a cessation
of hostilities agreement on 23 January, but it
was violated almost as soon as it was signed.
The parties subsequently recommitted to the
cessation of hostilities on 5 May and signed
an agreement to resolve the crisis on 9 May,
but fighting continued.
In June, participation in the IGAD
negotiations was broadened to include
other stakeholder groups. This included
several SPLM leaders who were detained in
December, accused of participating in an
attempted coup. Seven were released at the
end of January while four others stood trial
for treason, but were released at the end of
April after the government dropped charges
against them. Delegates from civil society,
Amnesty International Report 2014/15political parties and faith-based groups also
participated in the talks.
IGAD continued its efforts to reach a
political settlement. On 8 November, IGAD
heads of state issued a resolution granting
the warring parties 15 days to consult with
their constituencies on the structure of a
transitional government. The resolution
recommitted the parties to end all hostilities,
and provided that further violations of the
cessation of hostilities agreement would result
in asset freezes, travel bans and an arms
embargo. IGAD leaders further authorized
the IGAD region to intervene directly in South
Sudan to protect life and restore peace.
On 24 December 2013, the UN Security
Council approved an increase in the military
strength of the UN Mission in South Sudan
(UNMISS) to 12,500 troops and an increase
in the mission’s police force to a maximum
of 1,323 personnel. In May 2014, the
Security Council revised the mandate of
UNMISS to focus on protection of civilians,
monitoring and investigating human rights,
creating the conditions for the delivery of
humanitarian assistance, and supporting
the implementation of the cessation of
hostilities agreement.
A Commission of Inquiry was established
by the AU in March 2014, but its final report
had not yet been publicly released by the
end of the year. The AU Peace and Security
Council (PSC) repeatedly condemned the
killing of civilians and violations of the 23
January cessation of hostilities agreement
by both parties to the conflict. The AU
PSC also indicated its readiness, upon
recommendation by IGAD, to take targeted
sanctions and other measures against any
party that undermined the search for a
solution to the conflict.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
Both government and opposition forces
demonstrated a disregard for international
humanitarian law. Other armed groups,
including the opposition-allied White Army
and the Sudanese Justice and Equality
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Movement (JEM) fighting on behalf of the
government, also committed violations of
international humanitarian law.
In the days following the outbreak of
violence in Juba, government soldiers
targeted and killed people based on ethnicity
and assumed political affiliation. Hundreds
of Nuer civilians and government soldiers
who had been captured and disarmed or
otherwise placed hors de combat were
executed, mainly by Dinka members of the
armed forces. Many Nuer were killed in or
near their homes. Some men were picked up
at home or in the street, taken away and later
killed in other locations. In one incident, over
300 people were killed in a police building
in Gudele.
Parties to the conflict attacked civilians
sheltering in hospitals and places of worship.
For example, after government forces re-took
control of Bor town on 18 January, the bodies
of 18 women, all of them Dinka, were found
in and around the compound of St Andrew’s
Cathedral. They were believed to have been
victims of an attack by opposition forces. The
remains of 15 men and women were found at
Bor hospital. When opposition forces attacked
Malakal for the third time in mid-February,
they targeted Malakal Teaching Hospital,
where civilians had previously found safe
shelter. They shot dead a number of people.
Conflict-related sexual violence was
widespread. This included cases of gang
rape, of pregnant women being cut open and
of women being raped using wooden sticks
or plastic bottles. 1 At least four girls staying
at Christ the King Church in Malakal were
abducted by opposition forces on the night of
25 February and raped nearby.
Government and opposition forces
burned down homes, damaged and
destroyed medical facilities and looted public
institutions and private property as well as
food stores and humanitarian aid. Looting
and destruction left Bor, Bentiu, Malakal and
many other towns destroyed.
337UNICEF estimated that parties to the
conflict had recruited approximately 9,000
children to serve in armed forces and groups.
Civilians were injured, abducted and killed
within or in the immediate vicinity of UN
bases. On 19 December, approximately 2,000
armed youths surrounded the UNMISS base
in Akobo, Jonglei state, and opened fire,
killing two peacekeepers and an estimated
20 civilians who had sought refuge there. On
17 April, there was an armed assault on the
UNMISS base in Bor during which more than
50 internally displaced people were killed.
Obstruction of humanitarian assistance
significantly impeded civilians’ access to
life-saving assistance. Parties to the conflict
also attacked UN and humanitarian workers.
Members of the Mabanese Defense Force,
a government-allied militia, killed five
humanitarian workers of Nuer ethnicity in
August. The whereabouts of two Nuer UN
employees abducted in October by forces of
the government-allied Shilluk militia leader
Johnson Olony remained unknown. In
September, a UNMISS helicopter was shot
down, killing three of its crew members.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
The authorities, especially the National
Security Service (NSS), harassed and
intimidated journalists and human rights
defenders. The NSS summoned journalists
for questioning, arbitrarily detained journalists
and ordered a number of journalists to leave
the country.
In March, the NSS ordered the Almajhar
Alsayasy Arabic language newspaper to cease
publication because of its description of the
genesis of the conflict and for interviewing
politicians critical of the government.
In June, NSS officers contacted the editors
of several newspapers and instructed them
to stop publishing articles discussing the
federal system of government. On 2 July, NSS
officers went to the offices of Juba Monitor
and seized copies of the paper because
it contained two opinion pieces about
federalism. Around 15 armed NSS officers
338
confiscated all 3,000 copies of The Citizen
newspaper on the morning of 7 July.
On 1 August, Deng Athuai Mawiir, acting
chairperson of the South Sudan Civil Society
Alliance and a member of the civil society
delegation to the IGAD-brokered peace
negotiations, was shot in the thigh by an
unknown gunman. While the perpetrator and
motive for the attack remained unknown,
this incident contributed to a climate of fear
among civil society activists, journalists and
human rights defenders. 2
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The criminal justice system routinely failed
to ensure accountability for perpetrators of
human rights abuses due to weaknesses in
the criminal justice system. These included
inadequate technical capacity in investigatory
methods, a lack of forensic experts,
interference or resistance by security services
and the government and a lack of victim
support and witness protection programmes.
The justice system also failed to guarantee
due process and fair trials. Common human
rights violations included arbitrary arrest and
detention, prolonged pre-trial detention and
the failure to ensure the right of an accused
person to legal counsel.
Two UNMISS employees were arrested by
the NSS in Wau in August and transported to
Juba. They remained in detention at the NSS
headquarters at the end of the year. They
had not been charged or brought before a
competent legal authority.
The internal armed conflict exacerbated
pre-existing problems in the justice system,
particularly in Jonglei, Unity and Upper
Nile states. The capacity of the police and
judiciary to enforce the law was undermined
by militarization and the defection of many
police officers. Representatives of the
judiciary and the Ministry of Justice left these
states following the outbreak of violence and
had not returned to their posts by the end
of 2014.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS
The government did not conduct prompt,
thorough, impartial and independent
investigations with a view to prosecuting and
holding accountable individuals suspected
of crimes under international law and serious
violations of human rights.
President Kiir established a committee to
investigate human rights abuses allegedly
committed during an attempted coup on
15 December 2013. The committee’s eight
members were selected by the President’s
Office, its activities were funded by the
presidency and it was mandated to report
directly to the President. No report, or update
on its findings, was made public by the end
of the year.
The SPLA set up two investigation
committees at the end of December 2013.
In February 2014, the SPLA announced
that approximately 100 individuals had been
arrested as a result of investigations. However,
they all escaped on 5 March during a
gunfight among soldiers at the Giyada military
barracks in Juba, where they were detained.
In November, the SPLA announced that two
individuals had been rearrested for their
role in violations committed in December.
No information was made public about their
identity or the charges against them.
On 30 December 2013, the AU PSC
called for the establishment of an AU
Commission of Inquiry into human rights
violations and abuses committed during the
armed conflict in South Sudan. Its mandate
included recommending measures to ensure
accountability and reconciliation. Members
of the Commission, chaired by the former
president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo,
were sworn in by March 2014. In its June
interim report, the Commission of Inquiry
said it was not yet in a position to determine
whether crimes under international law
had been committed. The Commission of
Inquiry submitted its final report to the AU
Commission in October, but it had not been
publicly released by the end of the year. South Sudan was not party to any core
international or regional human rights treaties.
Although parliament voted to ratify several
treaties and President Kiir signed their
instruments of accession, the government
failed to formally deposit instruments of
accession with the AU or the UN. The
treaties were: the African Charter on Human
and Peoples’ Rights; the AU Convention
Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee
Problems in Africa; the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child; the UN Convention
against Torture; and the UN Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women.
A National Security Service Bill was passed
by Parliament on 8 October and was awaiting
presidential assent in December 2014. The
Bill grants the NSS broad powers, including
the power to arrest and detain, without
adequate provisions for independent oversight
or safeguards against abuse. National and
international human rights advocates as well
as a number of members of Parliament called
for President Kiir to refuse assent and to
return the Bill to parliament for revisions. 3
A draft Non-Governmental Organizations
Bill was being considered by Parliament,
which would restrict the right to freedom of
association. The Bill would make registration
compulsory, prohibit NGOs from operating
without being registered, and criminalize
voluntary activities carried out without a
registration certificate.
The national legal framework failed
to define and sanction crimes under
international law, including crimes against
humanity and genocide. It also failed to
define or criminalize torture. In addition, it
failed to provide for command or superior
responsibility as a mode of liability for crimes
under international law.

who participated declared their support for
independence.
No violent attacks by the Basque Euskadi
Ta Askatasuna (ETA) were reported during
the year, after ETA announced the end of its
armed struggle in 2011.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Throughout the year thousands of
demonstrations were organized to protest
against austerity measures imposed by the
government. Reports of abuses by police
against demonstrators continued. Thousands
of migrants, including asylum-seekers
and refugees, some fleeing from Syria,
attempted to irregularly enter the Spanish
enclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla from
Morocco. Reports of unlawful deportations
and excessive use of force by Spanish
border guards persisted. Throughout the year, hundreds of individuals
were detained and fined for participating
in spontaneous and mostly peaceful
demonstrations of more than 20 people.
The law regulating the right to freedom of
assembly failed to recognize the right to hold
spontaneous demonstrations.
By the end of the year, bills to amend
both the Criminal Code and the Law on the
Protection of Public Safety were still under
discussion in Parliament. If approved, they
would further restrict the exercise of freedoms
of assembly and expression. The draft Law
on the Protection of Public Safety, if adopted,
would introduce 21 additional offences,
including the unauthorized dissemination
of images that might put a police operation
at risk. It would also allow for the imposition
of fines on the organizers of peaceful
spontaneous protests and those showing a
lack of respect for law enforcement officers.
BACKGROUND EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Spain ratified the UN Arms Trade Treaty in
April, and in August became the first country
to update its regulations on arms transfers
to include the “Golden Rule” prohibiting
the transfer of arms where there was a real
risk that they would contribute to human
rights violations.
The teaching of human rights ceased
to be obligatory in primary and secondary
education following amendments to the
Education Act adopted in December 2013.
On 9 November, the government of
Catalonia held an informal consultation on
the political future of Catalonia, in defiance
of a Constitutional Court ruling ordering the
consultation’s suspension. 80% of those Excessive force was frequently used by
law enforcement officers to disperse and
detain protesters.
In April, the Parliament of Catalonia
banned the use of rubber balls by Catalan
police. In previous years, several peaceful
demonstrators were severely injured as
a result of police firing rubber balls to
disperse crowds.
In June, the Public Prosecutor requested
the closure of the investigation into allegations
of police abuses made by 26 participants in
the “Surround Congress” rally in September
2012. A judicial decision on the closure of
the case was still pending at the end of 2014.
In the course of the rally, unidentified police
officers beat peaceful demonstrators with

King Juan Carlos I de Borbón in June)

Amnesty International Report 2014/15batons, fired rubber bullets, and threatened
journalists covering the events.
In September, the investigating judge in
the case of Ester Quintana formally decided
to prosecute two law enforcement officers for
causing her serious bodily harm. She lost her
left eye after being struck by a rubber ball
fired by police officers at a demonstration in
Barcelona in November 2012.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
Spain continued to decline to implement
recommendations of international
human rights bodies to abolish the use
of incommunicado detention for those
suspected of terrorism-related offences.
By January at least 63 members of ETA
had been released following a ruling by the
European Court of Human Rights in 2013 in
the case of Del Rio Prada v. Spain that the
Spanish Supreme Court’s “Parot Doctrine”
on serious crimes violated the rights to liberty
and to no punishment without law. In a
reversal of earlier jurisprudence, a Supreme
Court ruling in 2006 effectively excluded the
possibility of early release for those sentenced
to consecutive terms of imprisonment on
multiple counts.
DISCRIMINATION
Law enforcement officers continued to carry
out identity checks on the basis of racial
or ethnic characteristics. The draft Law on
the Protection of Public Safety contained a
provision requiring identity checks to respect
the principle of non-discrimination.
During the year, data on hate crimes was
made public by the Ministry of Interior for the
first time. According to the Ministry, 1,172
hate crimes were registered in 2013, most on
the grounds of sexual orientation and identity
and ethnicity. However, a protocol on the
identification and registration of discriminatory
incidents by law enforcement officers was not
introduced. Not all regional security forces
provided data on hate crimes.
Despite a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that
the banning of full-face veils in municipal
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
buildings in the city of Lleida was unlawful,
similar legislation was introduced or proposed
in several municipalities during 2014. In
July, the Catalan government announced its
intention to ban the wearing of full-face veils
in public, but legislation to this effect had not
been adopted by the end of the year.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
According to the Ministry of Health, Social
Policy and Equality, 45 women were killed
by their partners or former partners during
the year.
In August, the CEDAW Committee found
that Spain had violated its obligations
under the CEDAW Convention by failing to
protect Angela González and her daughter
Andrea from domestic violence. Andrea was
murdered by her father in 2003. Despite
more than 30 complaints, and repeated
requests for protection, the courts had
authorized unsupervised visits between
Angela González’ former partner and Andrea.
Statistics published during the year
revealed a sharp decline in the rate of
prosecutions of reported incidents of gender-
based violence since the entry into force
of the Law on Comprehensive Protection
Measures against Gender-based Violence in
2005. The number of cases closed for lack of
evidence by the specialized court for gender
violence had increased by 158% between
2005 and 2013, prompting unheeded calls
for a review of the effectiveness of both the
Law and the specialized court .
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Unlawful treatment of migrants, refugees
and asylum-seekers, including their unlawful
deportation to Morocco, and unnecessary or
excessive use of force by law enforcement
officials, were reported in the Spanish
enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla throughout the
year. By the end of the year, more than 1,500
Syrian refugees were waiting to be transferred
to the mainland from the enclaves. In
October, the Popular Party Parliamentary
Group tabled an amendment to the draft
341Law on Public Security that would legalize
summary expulsions to Morocco from Ceuta
and Melilla.
In February a group of around 250
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers
originating from Sub-Saharan Africa
attempted to swim across the sea border
between Morocco and Ceuta. Officials from
the Civil Guard employed anti-riot equipment,
including rubber balls, blanks and smoke,
to stop them. Fifteen people drowned. A
judicial investigation was ongoing at the end
of the year.
Hundreds of thousands of irregular
migrants continued to have their access
to health care limited as a result of
the implementation of Royal Decree
Law 16/2012. With some exceptions,
undocumented migrants had to pay to receive
health care, including primary health care. In
November, the Council of Europe European
Committee of Social Rights highlighted that
Royal Decree Law 16/2012 contravened the
European Social Charter.
By the end of the year, the authorities
granted international protection to 1,205
people. Only 255 were granted refugee status.
Despite the government’s announcement in
December 2013 that it would resettle 130
Syrian refugees, by the end of 2014 none had
been resettled.
CRIMES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW
The definitions of enforced disappearance
and torture in Spanish legislation continued
to fall short of international human
rights standards.
Amendments to legislation governing
universal jurisdiction in Spain that entered
into force on 14 March limited the powers
of Spanish authorities to investigate crimes
under international law, including genocide,
enforced disappearance, crimes against
humanity and torture, committed outside
Spain. The reforms were criticized by the UN
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary
Disappearances and the UN Special
Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice,
342
reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence
in July.
IMPUNITY
The rights to truth, justice and reparation
for victims of crimes committed during
the Civil War (1936 to 1939) and under
Francisco Franco’s rule (1939 to 1975)
continued to be denied. Spanish authorities
failed to adequately assist the Argentine
judiciary, which has been exercising universal
jurisdiction to investigate crimes under
international law committed during the
Franco era.
In July, the UN Working Group on
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances
urged the Spanish authorities to strengthen
efforts to establish the fate and whereabouts
of persons disappeared during the
Franco era.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
In September the government withdrew a
draft bill, approved in December 2013, which
would have introduced a series of obstacles
to accessing a safe and legal abortion and
possibly increased the number of women
and girls resorting to dangerous, clandestine
abortion procedures. However, the
government reaffirmed its intention to reform
existing legislation and require parental
consent for girls between 16 and 18 years of
age wishing to access a legal abortion.
SRI LANKA
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
Head of state and government: Mahinda Rajapaksa
Unlawful detentions and torture by security
forces were carried out with impunity
as the authorities continued to rely on
the Prevention of Terrorism Act to arrest
and detain suspects without charge or
Amnesty International Report 2014/15trial. Human rights defenders and family
members of people subjected to enforced
disappearance were threatened and
arrested, and fatal attacks on religious
minorities went unpunished. Systematic
impunity for alleged war crimes and crimes
against humanity led the UN Human Rights
Council in March to pass a resolution
calling for a comprehensive investigation
to be undertaken by the UN Office of the
High Commissioner for Human Rights
– a move the government opposed and
refused to co-operate with. Human rights
defenders received threats of reprisals by
government officials and supporters if they
were suspected of contacting investigators
or otherwise advocating human rights
accountability. Political violence and
intimidation – mainly against political
opposition supporters and civil society
activists – were reported in the run-up to
the snap presidential election called for
January 2015.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Tamils suspected of links to the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continued to be
arrested and detained under the Prevention
of Terrorism Act (PTA) instead of ordinary
criminal law. The PTA permits extended
administrative detention, and shifts the
burden of proof to a detainee alleging torture
or other ill-treatment. It also restricts freedoms
of expression and association and has been
used to detain critics.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees
– including sexual violence – remained
widespread in Sri Lanka, especially at the
moment of apprehension and during early
stages of pre-trial detention. Victims reported
torture of both adult and juvenile detainees;
these included individuals arrested in the
context of security operations as well as
suspects in ordinary criminal cases.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Unnecessary and excessive use of force,
causing the deaths of demonstrators,
continued to be reported and to go
unpunished. In May, four army officers
suspended in the wake of an internal inquiry
into the shooting and killing of demonstrators
in a 2013 protest against pollution of the
water supply in Weliweriya were reinstated
and assigned to new posts. One victim in this
incident was reportedly beaten to death while
sheltering in a church. The army’s report on
the shooting was not made public.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
In June, the Friday Forum, an informal
citizens’ group, called on the Inspector
General of Police to take action against the
killings of criminal suspects while in police
custody. Police often claimed that the
suspects were killed in self-defence or while
trying to escape. The Bar Association of Sri
Lanka also condemned the killing of suspects
in police custody. In late 2013, four men who
had been arrested for the alleged murder of
a police constable and his wife died under
suspicious circumstances in custody within
a two-week period. The Bar Association
released a statement in December 2013
expressing concern that the police
explanations were virtually identical to those
of past cases and that the deaths appeared to
be extrajudicial executions.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
The ad hoc Presidential Commission to
Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing
Persons (the Disappearances Commission)
was appointed in August 2013 to examine
complaints between 10 June 1990 and 19
May 2009. It received some 15,000 civilian
complaints as well as about 5,000 cases of
missing armed forces personnel. By August
2014, the Commission had reportedly begun
inquiries into less than 5% of these cases,
or 462 complaints. Some complaints, which
the Commission said were being analyzed for
343further investigation, were potentially over a
decade old.
IMPUNITY
Serious violations of international law
committed during the armed conflict,
including enforced disappearances,
extrajudicial executions and the intentional
shelling of civilians and protected areas
such as hospitals, remain unaddressed.
The government continued to deny that
such violations occurred until 15 July when
it announced that it was expanding its
Disappearances Commission to investigate
other alleged crimes under international
law. A panel of international lawyers was
appointed to advise the government.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
Sri Lanka detained and forcefully deported
asylum-seekers without adequately assessing
their asylum claims, including individuals
who were registered with UNHCR, the UN
refugee agency, and were awaiting interviews.
Authorities arrested and detained 328
asylum-seekers between June and mid-
September, and deported 183 of them to
Pakistan and Afghanistan. UNHCR said in
September that it believed there were still
more than 100 people of concern to them in
detention, including 38 Pakistani nationals
and 64 Afghan nationals. Many belonged
to minority religious groups which were
subject to discrimination and violence in their
home countries.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Authorities continued to threaten, harass and
arrest human rights defenders, including
lawyers, family members of the disappeared
and other activists. None of the incidents
known to Amnesty International were
effectively investigated, and no prosecutions
were initiated. People calling for accountability
for past and current human rights violations,
including human rights defenders attempting
to communicate concerns to the UN, were
harassed and threatened. In some instances,
344
individuals suspected of “internationalizing”
these issues through association with foreign
colleagues were detained. Women activists
in northern Sri Lanka were questioned and
arrested: significantly, Balendran Jeyakumari,
whose son was the victim of an alleged
enforced disappearance, remained held
since her arbitrary detention under the PTA
in March. Prominent human rights defenders
Ruki Fernando and Father Praveen Mahesan
faced continued restrictions imposed by the
courts after they were arrested for attempting
to investigate her case. 1
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY,
ASSOCIATION AND MOVEMENT
There were continuing reports of intimidation
and harassment of journalists by state
officials, including physical attacks, death
threats and politically motivated charges.
Perpetrators acted with impunity in these
cases; none of the incidents were adequately
investigated, and those suspected of criminal
conduct were not prosecuted. Impunity also
persisted for older cases of violence against
journalists, including for unlawful killings and
enforced disappearances.
On 18 May, the fifth anniversary of the
end of Sri Lanka’s armed conflict, the military
sealed the offices of Uthayan, a Jaffna-based
newspaper. The newspaper and its employees
had faced previous forced closures, threats
and violent attacks.
Civil society organizations also came
under pressure. On 1 July, the Ministry of
Defence issued a memorandum to “all non-
governmental organizations” warning them to
stop holding press conferences, workshops
and journalists’ trainings, or disseminating
press releases.
Students in many parts of the country were
violently attacked, and there were repeated
efforts by the authorities to prevent them from
organizing, including by prohibiting student
unions and suspending student activists.
In October, travel restrictions were
reimposed requiring foreign travellers to the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Northern Province to obtain clearance from
the Ministry of Defence.
In December, election monitors recorded
dozens of reports of political violence,
including attacks on political rallies, assaults
and arson damage, most perpetrated by
members of the ruling party.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The independence of judicial institutions in
Sri Lanka was compromised by the removal
of checks and balances protecting the
separation of powers. The 18 th amendment
to the Constitution, passed in 2010, gave the
President the power to appoint and remove:
the Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme
Court; the President and judges of the Court
of Appeal; the Attorney General and members
of the Judicial Service Commission, which
is the body responsible for appointments,
transfers, dismissals and disciplinary control
of judicial officers. In 2013, after the Supreme
Court ruled against the government in
several important cases, the Chief Justice
was impeached by Parliament and then
removed from office by the President,
despite a Supreme Court decision that the
impeachment was unconstitutional.
DISCRIMINATION – ATTACKS
ON MINORITIES
Discrimination against ethnic, linguistic and
religious minorities, including members of
Tamil, Muslim and Christian communities,
continued. Minorities were singled out
for arbitrary restrictions on freedoms
of expression and association. Tamils,
particularly those from the north of the
country, were harassed, threatened and
arrested by security forces which suspected
them of sympathy or links with the LTTE,
based largely on their ethnicity and place of
origin or residence.
The army and police actively suppressed
the rights of northern Tamils to advocate for
justice publicly or to commemorate or mourn
those killed in the armed conflict. Hindu and
Christian religious observance was restricted
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
in Tamil communities of northern Sri Lanka
around key dates and the army’s requirement
that all public gatherings, including family
events, be reported to local military authorities
discouraged participation in these activities.
Police failed to protect religious minorities
when they faced violence by communal
forces, and did not arrest perpetrators
of such violence, even when there was
photographic evidence to identify them.
Threats, harassment and violence against
Muslims, Christians and their places of
worship escalated in 2014 when large-scale
violence in a Muslim neighbourhood in June
in Aluthgama resulted in deaths and injuries
among residents and the destruction of
homes and businesses.

SUDAN
Republic of the Sudan
Head of state and government: Omar Hassan
Ahmad al-Bashir
Freedoms of expression, association and
assembly were severely curtailed, with
crackdowns on the media, public dialogue
and demonstrations. The armed conflicts in
Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states
continued to cause mass displacement and
civilian casualties; human rights abuses
were perpetrated by all parties to the
conflicts. The government armed forces were
responsible for the destruction of civilian
buildings including schools, hospitals and
clinics in the conflict areas, and hindered
humanitarian access to civilians displaced
and otherwise affected by the ongoing
hostilities.
345BACKGROUND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
In January, President Omar al-Bashir
announced plans to achieve peace in Sudan
and protect constitutional rights through a
“national dialogue”, open to participation by
all parties and even armed movements. He
followed this up in April with a promise to
release all political detainees. Despite this
announcement, restrictions on freedoms
of expression, association and assembly
prevailed, hindering meaningful attempts at
a national dialogue. The national dialogue
ceased following the arrest of Al-Sadiq
Al-Mahdi, leader of the National Umma
Party, over his statements about the Rapid
Support Forces (RSF) pro-government militia,
whom he accused of committing crimes
against civilians.
In August, the National Umma Party and
the Sudan Revolutionary Front signed the
Paris Declaration, a joint statement calling
for widespread reform in Sudan. The two
parties declared that they would boycott
future general elections unless a transitional
government was first put in place to “provide
public freedoms” and end the ongoing
conflicts in Sudan’s Darfur, Blue Nile and
South Kordofan states. The ruling National
Congress Party refused to recognize the Paris
Declaration.
The conflicts in Darfur, Southern Kordofan
and Blue Nile states continued unabated.
Violations of human rights and international
humanitarian law perpetrated by government
forces and pro-government militias against
civilians continued throughout the year in
these three areas, and spread to Northern
Kordofan. In Darfur, the government
continued in its failure to protect civilians from
abuses during a surge in fighting between
predominantly ethnic Arab groups over land
and other natural resources, in which pro-
government militia participated.
The government was preparing for national
elections in 2015. The authorities increased restrictions on
freedoms of expression, association and
assembly throughout the country, in what
appeared to be a concerted effort to shut
down independent dialogue. The government
continued to use the National Intelligence
and Security Services (NISS) and other
security forces to arbitrarily detain perceived
opponents of the ruling National Congress
Party, to censor media and to shut down
public forums and protests. The arbitrary
detention of activists, human rights defenders
and political opposition figures continued
unabated. These restrictions severely
undermined the activities of civil society and
prevented meaningful public consultation
on Sudan’s new Constitution, which the
government declared would be based on
Shari’a law.
Newspapers continued to be subject to
closure and censorship for printing material
perceived as being critical of the ruling
National Congress Party. Journalists received
threats from the NISS, which also seized
entire print runs, causing large financial
losses for newspapers. Eighteen newspapers
repeatedly had their editions confiscated
between January and September. By the end
of the year, the authorities had confiscated
newspapers 52 times. Al Jareeda newspaper,
an independent daily publication, was
arbitrarily confiscated by the NISS on 24
September. Al Jareeda had been suspended
by the NISS 11 times by the end of the year.
Al Siha, another newspaper, was suspended
indefinitely by the NISS on 6 June.
The government also lifted the ban on three
newspapers. On 29 January, the government
lifted a two-year ban onRay al-Shaab
newspaper, affiliated to the Popular Congress
Party. A two-year suspension againstAl
Tayar newspaper was lifted on 5 March.
The suspension of Al Midan newspaper
imposed on 3 May 2012 was lifted on 6
March. Al Midan is affiliated to the Sudanese
Communist Party.
346
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Taj Aldeen Arjaa, a 23-year-old Darfuri
activist and blogger, was released from prison
on 11 May. He was arrested by the NISS in
Khartoum on 26 December 2013 after he
verbally criticized President Omar al-Bashir
and the President of Chad, Idriss Deby, at
a joint press conference. He was reportedly
tortured while in prison.
ARMED CONFLICT
Darfur
Widespread human rights abuses continued
throughout Darfur. Civilians were displaced
in large numbers as a result of violence
between warring communities and attacks
by government-allied militias and armed
opposition groups.
In late February the government deployed
the RSF in Darfur. The RSF drew many of its
recruits from the former Janjaweed militias
that in previous years were responsible for
serious human rights violations, including
unlawful killings and rape. The RSF destroyed
scores of villages, causing a significant
increase in displacement and civilian deaths.
Between January and July an estimated
388,000 people were displaced in Darfur,
in addition to the 2 million displaced since
the conflict in Darfur began in 2003. Many
of those internally displaced were in remote
areas where they received little or no
humanitarian assistance and were vulnerable
to attacks, abduction and sexual violence.
On 22 March, the Khor Abeche camp for
internally displaced persons in South Darfur
was attacked by a group of armed men who
looted and burned the camp to the ground.
The government continued to restrict
access to areas of Darfur affected by conflict
to the AU, the United Nations Mission
in Darfur (UNAMID) and humanitarian
organizations. In February, the International
Committee of the Red Cross’ main activities
were suspended, while other organizations,
such as the French development organization
Agence d’Aide à la Coopération Technique et
au Développement (ACTED), had their offices
shut down.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
On 2 July, UN Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon announced a review of investigations
and reviews into UNAMID performance that
had been carried out over the previous two
years. This review, which was concluded
in October, was announced in response to
allegations that UNAMID staff had covered
up human rights abuses in Darfur. The
review did not find any evidence to support
the allegations. However, it found that
UNAMID had a tendency to under-report
and maintained media silence in incidents
involving human rights violations.
South Kordofan and Blue Nile
The armed conflict between government
forces and the Sudan People’s Liberation
Army-North (SPLA-North) continued in
South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, with
indiscriminate attacks by both parties.
Sudanese forces employed indiscriminate
aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian
villages. They also employed proxy forces
in ground assaults, including the RSF.
These proxy forces also perpetrated human
rights abuses.
Many of the more than 1 million people
displaced in the three-year conflict remained
in Sudan. More than 200,000 were living in
refugee camps in South Sudan or Ethiopia.
On 14 April, the government publicly
launched its “Decisive Summer” military
operation to “end all rebellion” in South
Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur. From
the onset of the operation, the Sudanese
Armed Forces carried out sustained aerial
bombardments in and around Kauda, a major
town in Heiban County, as well as aerial
bombardments and shelling in Um Dorein
and Delami counties, destroying schools,
clinics, hospitals and other civilian buildings
and forcing people to flee their homes.
Sudan continued to obstruct humanitarian
access to areas controlled by the SPLA-North.
Both parties to the conflict failed to meet their
obligation to facilitate humanitarian access.
347FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
Amid the calls for national dialogue and
political accommodation, Sudan continued to
restrict the legitimate activities of opposition
political parties and civil society. On 8
March, NISS prevented some 30 civil society
organizations from celebrating International
Women’s Day in Khartoum.
On 11 March, economics student Ali
Abakar Musa died from gunshot wounds
sustained when security services opened
fire during a demonstration at the University
of Khartoum. The demonstration took place
immediately after the conclusion of a public
forum organized by the Darfur Students’
Association concerning escalating violence in
South Darfur. Students marched to the main
university gate, where they were met by the
police, NISS and student militias. The security
services fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live
ammunition at the students.
On 15 March, the authorities banned the
National Consensus Forces – a coalition
of 17 opposition political parties – from
holding a public event in Khartoum North
and deployed hundreds of security agents
to cancel the event. On 1 May, the Political
Parties Affairs Council – a government body
– rejected the Republican Party application
for registration; the Republican Party was
considered heretical for its progressive views
on Islam. The founder of the party, Mahmoud
Mohammed Taha, was executed for apostasy
in 1985.
On 29 May, 13 June and 17 August, the
authorities refused to allow political and civil
society activists to submit memorandums
highlighting human rights violations by the
government to the Sudan National Human
Rights Commission office in Khartoum.
On 28 August, security forces forcibly
prevented protesters from demanding the
release of women political prisoners in
front of Omdurman women's prison. The
security services arrested 16 women activists
and used tear gas and batons to disperse
the protesters.
348
Three high-profile political leaders were
arrested either for expressing their political
opinion or for participating in peaceful
political activities. On 17 May, Al Sadiq
al-Mahdi, the former prime minister and
leader of the opposition National Umma Party
(NUP), was arrested after he accused the
RSF of committing violations and abusing
civilians. He was released without charge
on 15 June. On 8 June, the leader of the
Sudanese Congress Party, Ibrahim Al Sheikh
Abdel Rahman, was arrested in Nuhud,
North Kordofan following his criticism of the
RSF. He was released without charge on
15 September. Mariam Al Sadiq al-Mahdi,
deputy leader of NUP, was arrested in
Khartoum on 11 August after attending talks
in Paris, France, between the NUP and the

without charge a month later.
In an attempt to stop a series of events
organized to commemorate the deaths of

its powers of “preventive detention”. Those
arrested were released without charge in
early October.
Former detainees reported they were
tortured and otherwise ill-treated while
in detention.

IMPUNITY
Following a request by the accused, Edgar
Ritfeld, in 2013 the Court of Justice ordered
the resumption of Edgar Ritfeld’s trial in
a military court in January 2014. Edgar
Ritfeld, who claims he is innocent, is one
of 25 people accused of the extrajudicial
executions of 15 opponents of the then
military government in December 1982. The
trial had been halted since 2012 following
an amendment to the 1992 amnesty law
granting immunity for the alleged torture
and extrajudicial executions committed in
December 1982. The 25 accused, including
current President Desiré Delano “Dési”
Bouterse, who was the country’s military
leader at the time of the killings, were put on
trial before a military court in November 2007
for the killings.
Although the Court of Justice decided that
the case of Edgar Ritfeld should resume,
the military court decided in October not to
resume the trial of the 24 others, including
the trial of President Bouterse.
In August, families of the 15 people
killed in December 1982 filed a case
before the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights. The crisis in the rule of law and judicial
independence deepened. The rights to
freedom of expression, association and
assembly continued to be violated. Unfair
trials resulted in imprisonment for reasons
of opinion and conscience.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
In November Swaziland lost its preferential
trade agreement under the African Growth
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) with the USA
after the government failed to take reform
measures, which it had voluntarily undertaken
to do in 2013, to address restrictions on
freedoms of association, assembly and
expression. The benchmarks included
amending the Suppression of Terrorism
Act, the Public Order Act and the Industrial
Relations Act. The loss of preferential access
to the US market for textiles led to almost
immediate factory closures.
LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS
The rule of law, access to effective remedies
and protection of human rights continued to
deteriorate as a consequence of the further
undermining of judicial independence.
349against activists for wearing TUCOSWA
T-shirts or for attempting to hold meetings.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Journalists, lawyers, independent-
minded judges, trade union officials and
parliamentarians were threatened with
violence, arrest, prosecution or other forms of
pressure as a consequence of their advocacy
for human rights, respect for the rule of law or
for political reforms.
UNFAIR TRIALS
There was an upsurge in politically motivated
trials and the use of laws which violate the
principle of legality to suppress dissent.
On 25 July Bheki Makhubu, editor of the
monthly news magazine The Nation, and
human rights lawyer Thulani Maseko were
sentenced by the High Court to two years in
prison for contempt of court after a grossly
unfair trial. 1 The two men were sentenced
following their conviction on 17 July on two
counts of contempt of court. In addition, The
Nation, a small independent publication, and
Swaziland Independent Publishers were fined
50,000 emalangeni (US$4,273) for each of
the two counts, with the total payable within
one month.
In March the two men were arrested after
The Nation published their articles raising
concerns about judicial independence
and political accountability in Swaziland.
The warrant used to arrest them, issued
by Swaziland’s Chief Justice Michael
Ramodibedi, subverted the normal legal
process. The police at Mbabane police
station, where the men were initially detained
prior to their appearance before the Chief
Justice, also appeared to have been acting
under instructions when they denied the
men’s lawyers access to them in the police
cells. The two men were remanded into
custody by the Chief Justice following a
brief procedure behind closed doors in his
office. In April, they were briefly released,
following a ruling by High Court judge
Mumcy Dlamini that the warrants used to
350
arrest them were defective. The Chief Justice
immediately lodged an appeal against this
ruling, the two men were rearrested and the
trial against them began under High Court
judge Mpendulo Simelane. The judge had
a clear conflict of interest in the matter as
he was named in one of the cited articles
and intervened as a factual witness during
the course of the trial. When sentencing the
defendants, Judge Simelane criticized their
“disgusting conduct”, for running a “defiance
campaign” against the administration of
justice with “scurrilous” articles and, in
respect of Thulani Maseko, for “pursuing
regime change”. An appeal was lodged by
the two men and The Nation against the
convictions and sentences.
In May, the Supreme Court overturned
Bheki Makhubu’s previous conviction in 2013
for one of two charges against him arising
from an earlier article in The Nation on the
importance of the judiciary in entrenching
respect for the Constitution and improving
the lives of the people. The Supreme
Court upheld the conviction on the second
charge arising from an article concerning
the conduct of the country’s powerful Chief
Justice, but overturned the sentence of two
years’ imprisonment if the editor failed to
pay a fine equivalent to nearly US$45,000
within three days. The Supreme Court judges
substituted a fine equivalent of US$3,000
and a suspended sentence of three months’
imprisonment conditional on not being
convicted of a similar offence.
Activists were also detained and charged
in several separate trials involving charges
under the Suppression of Terrorism Act (STA)
and the Sedition and Subversive Activities
Act. The state revived a 2009 sedition charge
against Thulani Maseko. His trial on this
charge was scheduled to be heard in 2015.
A challenge to the constitutionality of the
Sedition and Subversive Activities Act, as well
as the STA, was also pending in 2015. The
challenge was brought by veteran activist
and leader of the opposition People’s United
Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), Mario
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Masuku, and eight others facing charges
under both laws in three separate trials. The
application was due to be heard in the High
Court in March 2015.
The trial of Mario Masuku and youth leader
Maxwell Dlamini was due to begin in February
2015. They were charged with sedition and
remanded in custody in connection with
slogans they allegedly shouted at a 2014 May
Day rally. There was considerable concern
at Mario Masuku’s deteriorating health after
he was remanded into custody. At the end
of October there was a renewed attempt to
secure his and Maxwell Dlamini’s release
on bail. On 31 October the High Court
judge scheduled to hear the application
was withdrawn. The application was
heard and rejected in November by Judge
Mpendulo Simelane.
Seven members of PUDEMO, which is
banned under the STA, were also facing trial
at the end of the year on charges under the
STA following their arrest at the High Court
during the trial of Thulani Maseko and Bheki
Makhubu in April.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Despite high levels of gender-based violence,
the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence
Bill had not been enacted by the end of the
year. The Bill had been under discussion
and consideration by parliament since
2006. Women’s rights and service-providing
organizations appealed for the enactment of
the Bill in November.

Head of government: Stefan Löfven (replaced
Fredrik Reinfeldt in October)
An Egyptian national, who had been
subjected to rendition from Sweden to Egypt
in 2001, and subsequently tortured, was
granted permission to return to Sweden.
Investigations into an illegal Swedish police
database of Romani people were ongoing. A
governmental commission began to review
shortcomings in rape investigations and
prosecutions.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In November, the UN Committee against
Torture recommended that Sweden adopt
a definition of torture into its Criminal Code
which was consistent with the UN Convention
against Torture. 1 The Committee also called
on Sweden to refrain from using diplomatic
assurances as a means of returning a person
to another country where the person would
face a risk of torture.
In April, Egyptian national Mohammed
al-Zari was granted a residence permit in
Sweden. He was detained with Ahmed Agiza
in Sweden in December 2001 and subjected
to rendition from Sweden to Egypt on a CIA-
leased plane. Both men were subsequently
tortured and otherwise ill-treated while
being held in Egypt. In 2008, the Chancellor
of Justice awarded both men financial
compensation for the human rights violations
they suffered. Mohammed al-Zari was
released from prison in October 2003 without
having been charged with any crime. The
award of a residence permit partially fulfilled
his right to redress for the human rights
violations he suffered. However, an effective,
independent investigation into these violations
remained outstanding.
351DISCRIMINATION
In September 2013, the CERD Committee
expressed concern about racially motivated
hate speech against visible minorities, and
called on Sweden to effectively investigate,
prosecute and punish all hate crimes. The
Committee also raised concerns about racist
and extremist organizations continuing to
function in Sweden.
On the same day that the CERD Committee
raised concerns about discrimination against
Roma, a Swedish newspaper revealed that
the Skåne police department was operating
an illegal database, named Travellers or
Nomads (Kringresande), containing details
of about 4,000 Romani people, for no
apparent reason other than their ethnicity. 2
Local and national authorities apologized
publicly following the revelations. The
matter was subsequently investigated
by Sweden’s Commission on Security
and Integrity Protection (Säkerhets - och
integritetsskyddsnämnden) and the National
Police-related Crimes Unit (Riksenheten
för polismål), as well as internally by the
National Police Board (Rikspolisstyrelsen),
the latter of which found no illegality. The
matter was under investigation by the Justice
Ombudsman, whose findings were expected
in November.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
In August, following an initiative by the
parliamentary Committee on Justice, the
government announced that it would set
up a commission to examine how rape
investigations are dealt with by the police
and justice system. The aim was to analyze
high rates of attrition in investigating
and prosecuting reported rapes, and to
recommend improvements to the legal
process in rape cases. The commission is
expected to review the penal provisions on the
offence of rape and to consider a requirement
for genuine consent.

Swiss Confederation
Head of state and government: Didier Burkhalter
The Swiss National Commission for the
Prevention of Torture (NCPT) and NGOs
continued to raise concern about the use
of force during deportations. “Popular
initiatives” that were incompatible with
international law were left unimplemented.
DISCRIMINATION
In March, the UN CERD Committee
recommended that the government introduce
a clear and comprehensive definition of direct
and indirect racial discrimination covering all
fields of law. The Committee further called
on the government to establish effective
data collection on discrimination and to take
measures to prevent targeting of individuals
for identity checks, searches and other
police operations on the grounds of race
and ethnicity.
In November, the Administrative Court in
the canton of St Gallen ruled that a school’s
ban on a Muslim student wearing a headscarf
was disproportionate.
In September 2013, residents of the
canton of Ticino had voted to ban the
wearing of the full face veil. The ban cannot
enter into force without the approval of the
Federal Parliament.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
The NCPT and domestic NGOs continued
to raise concerns about the treatment of
asylum-seekers, including violations of the
non-refoulement principle and the use of
force during removals.
The NCPT continued to observe and
document disproportionate use of force
and restraints during the transfer of people
facing deportation from detention centres
to the airport. To tackle varying practices by
different police forces, the NCPT called for
uniform practice and national regulation to
be introduced by the Conference of Cantonal
Directors of Justice and Police. The NCPT
also called for greater respect for the principle
of the best interests of the child, in response
to the ongoing practice of temporarily
separating children from their parents during
forced returns.
In May, the Federal Office for Migration
(FOM) made public the recommendations of
internal and external reviews, following the
arrests in Sri Lanka in July and August 2013
of two Tamil asylum-seekers forcibly returned
from Switzerland. The two men were detained
for several months by Sri Lankan authorities
and transferred to a “rehabilitation” camp.
In September 2013, following concerns
raised by NGOs, the FOM had temporarily
halted forced returns to Sri Lanka pending
the outcome of the reviews. After a further
fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka by Swiss
authorities, the FOM announced in May that it
would review the cases of Sri Lankan asylum-
seekers whose applications had received
a final rejection, and resume removals to
Sri Lanka.
in a cell measuring 23 square meters
designed for three detainees, without access
to any activities. The NCPT and Swiss
NGOs repeatedly raised concerns about
overcrowding in Champ-Dollon prison, which
as of November held 811 persons in a space
designed to accommodate 376. Disturbances
at the prison in February resulted in injuries
to eight guards and around 30 prisoners.
LEGISLATIVE, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In March, the CERD Committee
recommended establishing an independent
mechanism to ensure that “popular
initiatives” do not lead to laws that are
incompatible with Switzerland‘s obligations
under international human rights law. Several
“popular initiatives” or referendums put
forward by the Swiss People’s Party were not
implemented due to their incompatibility with
international law, including the referendum
known as the "Deportation initiative", passed
in 2010. This referendum had called for
a constitutional amendment to allow the
automatic deportation of foreign nationals
convicted of specified criminal offences.
Similarly, the “Mass immigration initiative”,
which sought to introduce an arbitrary
annual immigration quota, also remained
unimplemented.
SYRIA
PRISON CONDITIONS Syrian Arab Republic
Head of state: Bashar al-Assad
Head of government: Wael Nader al-Halqi
On 26 February, the Swiss Federal Court
ruled that two prisoners being held in
Champ-Dollon prison, in Geneva, were
subject to inhumane conditions that breached
Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights. The two prisoners were held
consecutively for three months, confined for
23 hours per day with four other detainees Syria’s internal armed conflict continued
relentlessly through the year and saw both
government forces and non-state armed
groups commit extensive war crimes and
gross human rights abuses with impunity.
Government forces deliberately targeted
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
353civilians, indiscriminately bombarding
civilian residential areas and medical
facilities with artillery, mortars, barrel
bombs and chemical agents, unlawfully
killing civilians. Government forces also
enforced lengthy sieges, trapping civilians
and depriving them of food, medical
care and other necessities. Security
forces arbitrarily arrested or continued
to detain thousands, including peaceful
activists, human rights defenders, media
and humanitarian workers, and children,
subjecting some to enforced disappearance
and others to prolonged detention or
unfair trials. Security forces systematically
tortured and otherwise ill-treated detainees
with impunity; thousands of detainees
reportedly died due to torture or harsh
conditions. Non-state armed groups, which
controlled some areas and contested others,
indiscriminately shelled and besieged areas
containing civilians perceived to support the
government. Some, particularly the Islamic
State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) armed
group, carried out indiscriminate suicide
attacks and other bombings in civilian areas,
and perpetrated numerous unlawful killings,
including summary killings of captives and
suspected opponents.
BACKGROUND
Fighting between government and disparate
non-state armed groups continued to rage
across Syria throughout the year, killing
and injuring thousands and causing further
mass population displacement and refugee
outflows, particularly to Turkey, Lebanon,
Jordan, Egypt and the Kurdistan Region
of Iraq. By the end of the year, the conflict
had caused a total of around 200,000
deaths, according to the UN. In addition, 7.6
million people were internally displaced and
approximately 4 million had become refugees
in other countries.
International efforts to resolve the armed
conflict saw the UN, with support from the
USA and Russia, convene the Geneva II
conference in January. It was attended by
354
representatives of the Syrian government
and the opposition Syrian National Coalition,
but not by armed groups outside the Syrian
National Coalition’s military command.
The talks concluded in February without
any agreement.
The UN Security Council remained
divided on the issue, undermining efforts to
pursue a peace agreement, but adopted a
series of resolutions on the crisis. Resolution
2139 in February addressed the conduct
of hostilities and arbitrary detentions, and
demanded that all parties to the conflict allow
humanitarian access across conflict lines and
to besieged areas; however, they failed to do
so. Resolution 2165 in July focused on the
delivery of international humanitarian aid to
besieged areas and across national borders.
In August, resolution 2170 condemned
unlawful killings, other gross abuses and
recruitment of foreign fighters by the armed
groups IS and Jabhat al-Nusra, and added
six individuals affiliated with them to the UN
al-Qa’ida Sanctions List. The UN Security
Council failed to adopt other measures to
address impunity in Syria. Russia and China
vetoed a draft resolution to refer the situation
in Syria to the Prosecutor of the International
Criminal Court.
The independent international Commission
of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic,
established by the UN Human Rights Council
in 2011, continued to monitor and report
on violations of international law committed
by the parties to the conflict. However, it
remained barred by the government from
entering Syria.
In June, the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reported that
the government had completed the handover
of its chemical weapons stockpile for
international destruction, in accordance with
a September 2013 agreement with the US
and Russian governments.
In September, a US-led international
coalition began air strikes against IS and other
armed groups in northern Syria. According to
Amnesty International Report 2014/15the UN Security Council, the air strikes killed
some 50 civilians.
In June, President al-Assad won
presidential elections held only in
government-controlled areas, and returned
to office for a third seven-year term. The
following week, he announced an amnesty,
which resulted in few prisoner releases;
the vast majority of prisoners of conscience
and other political prisoners held by the
government continued to be detained.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT –
VIOLATIONS BY GOVERNMENT FORCES
Use of indiscriminate and prohibited weapons
Government forces mounted attacks on
areas controlled or contested by armed
opposition forces and committed unlawful
killings of civilians; some attacks amounted
to war crimes or crimes against humanity.
Government forces repeatedly carried out
both direct and indiscriminate attacks,
including air strikes and artillery shelling
of civilian residential areas, often using
barrel bombs – high explosive unguided
weapons dropped from helicopters – causing
numerous civilian deaths and injuries,
including of children. Despite the demand
of UN Security Council resolution 2139 that
all parties to the conflict end indiscriminate
attacks, in the 10 months following the
resolution’s adoption, government forces
killed almost 8,000 civilians in shelling and
other indiscriminate attacks, according to
the Violations Documentation Centre, a local
monitoring NGO. In one incident on 29
October, government helicopters dropped
four barrel bombs on a camp for displaced
people in Idleb, killing at least 10 civilians and
wounding dozens, according to the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights.
Government forces carried out several
attacks using barrel bombs or other munitions
containing chlorine, despite such munitions
being prohibited under international law.
Attacks using such munitions included
those in April on the towns of Kafar Zeita,
al-Tamana’a and Tal Minnis, according to the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
UN’s Commission of Inquiry. A fact-finding
investigation by the OPCW confirmed in
September that government forces had used
chlorine “systematically and repeatedly” in
these attacks. Government forces also used
cluster munitions, indiscriminate weapons
that deploy incendiary bomblets over a
wide area exposing victims to serious, often
fatal, burns.
Sieges and denial of humanitarian access
Government forces maintained long-running
sieges of civilian areas in and around
Damascus, including Yarmouk, Daraya and
Eastern Ghouta, and elsewhere, including
the Old City of Homs siege which ended in
May. Armed opposition fighters were usually
present in besieged areas and sometimes also
posed a threat to civilians. Civilians trapped
within the besieged areas faced starvation,
lack of medical care and basic services, and
were repeatedly exposed to artillery shelling,
bombing from the air and sniper fire from
government soldiers. In March, government
soldiers fired on civilians who had sought
to leave Eastern Ghouta under a white flag,
killing women, men and children. Yarmouk, a
Damascus suburb containing around 18,000
of the over 180,000 Palestinian refugees
and Syrians who had lived there prior to the
conflict, entered a third year of continuous
siege in December. Despite a truce agreed
in June, government forces continued to cut
off food and water supplies and block some
international humanitarian aid. When they
allowed civilian evacuations from besieged
areas, government forces detained men and
boys among those evacuated, subjecting
many to long-term detention for “screening”.
Attacks on medical facilities and workers
Government forces continued to target
health facilities and medical workers in areas
controlled by armed groups. They bombed
hospitals, barred the provision of medical
supplies in humanitarian aid shipments to
besieged areas, and arrested and detained
medical workers and volunteers, apparently
to disrupt and deny basic health care services
in those areas. Physicians for Human Rights
355accused government forces of systematically
attacking the health care system in areas
controlled by opposition groups and of having
killed 569 health professionals between April
2011 and October 2014.
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT –
ABUSES BY ARMED GROUPS
Non-state armed groups also committed war
crimes and gross abuses of human rights.
These included IS and Jabhat al-Nusra, both
of which used foreign fighters, and groups
that formed part of or were affiliated to the
Free Syrian Army.
Use of indiscriminate weapons
Armed groups used indiscriminate weapons,
including mortars, tank and artillery shells,
during attacks on government-held civilian
areas, causing many civilian casualties. In
April and May, armed groups that attacked
the Saif al-Dawla, al-Midan and al-Sulimaniya
neighbourhoods in western Aleppo reportedly
fired mortar shells and improvised gas-
canister explosives into civilian areas. Jabhat
al-Nusra carried out suicide car and lorry
bombings in government-controlled areas,
including Homs, killing and injuring civilians.
Unlawful killings
IS forces, in particular, committed unlawful
killings of captured government soldiers,
abducted civilians, including peaceful
activists and media workers, foreigners and,
reportedly, members of rival armed groups.
In the al-Raqqa and eastern Aleppo areas,
which IS controlled and subjected to its strict
interpretation of Islamic law, IS members
carried out frequent public executions;
victims were first denounced, then shot
or beheaded in front of crowds that often
contained children. Most victims were men,
but they also reportedly included boys as
young as 15 and women.
IS forces publicized some of their crimes
for propaganda purposes or to make
demands, posting videos on the internet
showing them beheading captives, including
Syrian, Lebanese and Kurdish soldiers, and
American and British journalists and aid
356
workers who had been abducted by armed
groups and transferred or “sold” to IS. In
some cases, the beheading videos included
threats to kill other captives.
Sieges, denial of humanitarian access and attacks
on medical facilities and workers
IS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other armed groups
jointly or separately laid siege to several
government-held areas, including Zahraa
and Nobel, northwest of Aleppo, as well
as the area around Aleppo Central Prison
until government forces broke that year-
long siege in May. They shelled some areas
indiscriminately, cut off food, water and
other supplies to the civilian inhabitants,
interfered with or prevented the distribution of
humanitarian aid, and attacked and detained
medical workers.
Abductions
Armed groups were responsible for numerous
abductions and detentions of local activists,
suspected government supporters, foreign
journalists and aid workers, and others,
subjecting many to torture or other ill-
treatment and some to unlawful summary
executions. Those held included children; in
May, for example, IS forces abducted over
150 Kurdish boys from Manbej, between
Aleppo and Kobani, subjecting some to
torture. All had been released by October.
Kurdish areas
In northern Syria, the Democratic Union Party
(PYD) largely controlled three predominantly
Kurdish enclaves – ‘Afrin, Kobani (also known
as Ayn al-Arab) and Jazeera – following the
withdrawal of government troops in 2012,
until IS forces again attacked Kobani mid-
year, causing massive forced displacement.
In January, the PYD issued a new constitution
for the three areas, where it had established a
functioning justice system based on so-called
Peoples’ Courts. After visiting the area in
February, Human Rights Watch urged the
PYD authorities to stop arbitrary detentions,
cease the use of children as soldiers and to
man checkpoints, improve safeguards against
detainee abuse, and investigate a spate of
abductions and apparent political killings.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In July, the PYD demobilized 149 children
from their armed ranks and committed
to preventing children from taking part in
hostilities.
REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY
DISPLACED PEOPLE
Fighting across Syria continued to cause
massive forced displacement of civilians.
Approximately 4 million refugees fled from
Syria between 2011 and the end of 2014,
while the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs reported that another
7.6 million people, half of them children, were
internally displaced within Syria, an increase
of more than 1 million since December
2013. In September, a renewed attack by IS
forces on Kobani caused a massive refugee
outflow, with tens of thousands of inhabitants
crossing into Turkey in the space of a few
days. In both Lebanon and Jordan, authorities
limited the number of refugees entering
from Syria, exposing those waiting in border
areas to further attacks and deprivation, and
continued to block the entry of Palestinian
refugees from Syria, rendering them
especially vulnerable.
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Government security forces continued to
hold thousands of uncharged detainees
in prolonged pre-trial detention, many
in conditions that amounted to enforced
disappearance.
Many prisoners arrested in previous
years remained forcibly disappeared, amid
concerns for their safety. The authorities
rarely disclosed information about detainees
and frequently denied them access to lawyers
and their families.
Those who remained disappeared included
entire families, among them married couple
Abdulrahman Yasin and Rania Alabbasi,
their six children aged between three and 15,
and another woman who was present when
security forces detained them at their home
in March 2013. The authorities disclosed
no information about them but a former
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
detainee reported seeing Rania Alabbasi and
her children in a Military Intelligence facility
known as Branch 291.
Human rights lawyer Khalil Ma’touq and
his friend Mohamed Thatha remained victims
of enforced disappearance at the end of the
year, after security forces detained them at
a checkpoint near Damascus on 2 October
2013. The authorities did not confirm their
arrest or disclose why or where they were
being held, raising concerns for their safety.
Juwan Abd Rahman Khaled, a Kurdish
rights activist, was also a victim of continued
enforced disappearance. He was detained
by State Security officials who raided the
Wadi al-Mashari’a district of Damascus in the
early hours of 3 September 2012. A former
political detainee and victim of torture, his
whereabouts and fate remained undisclosed
at the end of 2014.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees
being held by Political Security, Military
Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence and
other government security and intelligence
branches remained systematic and
widespread. Torture reportedly continued to
result in a high incidence of detainee deaths.
In January, a group of forensic experts and
former international war crimes prosecutors
examined photographs taken at military
hospitals of thousands of corpses of prisoners
and reported that the Syrian authorities had
engaged in systematic torture and unlawful
killings of detainees. The government denied
the experts’ claim but failed to conduct an
independent investigation amid continuing
reports of torture and detainees’ deaths
during the year.
Many detainees were also reported to
have died due to harsh conditions at various
detention facilities. These included Military
Intelligence Branch 235, also known as the
“Palestine Branch”. One released detainee
reported that many detainees at Branch
235 had scabies or other skin ailments
and digestive illnesses due to severe
357overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and
a lack of food, clean drinking water and
medical care. Often, detainees’ families were
not officially informed of their deaths; in other
cases, families were told that detainees had
died of heart attacks, but were denied access
to their bodies, which were not returned to
them for burial.
In October, a UK inquest jury ruled that
British medical doctor Abbas Khan was
unlawfully killed in Syrian detention in
December 2013, contradicting a Syrian
government finding that he had committed
suicide. Security forces had arrested Dr Khan
in November 2012 within 48 hours of his
arrival as a medical volunteer in Syria; he was
reported to have been tortured and otherwise
ill-treated during months in detention. acts” and possible 15-year prison terms. They
were arrested when Air Force Intelligence
officials raided the SCM’s Damascus office
in February 2012. Their trial before the Anti-
Terrorism Court was adjourned continuously
since February 2013; the outcome of their
case remained unknown at the end of 2014.
Gebrail Moushe Kourie, president of
the unauthorized political party Assyrian
Democratic Organization, was arrested in
December 2013 in Qamishly in northern
Syria. After months of detention in facilities
where torture was rife, he was charged with
belonging to “an unlicensed secret political
party” and “incitement of violence to topple
the government” before a criminal court
judge who referred him for trial by the Anti-
Terrorism Court.
UNFAIR TRIALS DEATH PENALTY
After often lengthy periods of pre-trial
detention, scores of perceived government
critics and peaceful opponents were
prosecuted before the Anti-Terrorism Court,
established in 2012, and Military Field Courts,
where they did not receive fair trials. Some
defendants tried by the Anti-Terrorism Court
faced charges based on their legitimate
exercise of freedom of expression or other
rights. Defendants before Military Field
Courts, many of whom were civilians, had no
right to legal representation and faced judges
who were serving military officers. They also
had no opportunity to appeal their sentences.
Faten Rajab Fawaz, a physicist and
peaceful pro-reform activist arrested by Air
Force Intelligence officials in December 2011
in Damascus, was reported in September to
be facing trial before a Military Field Court on
undisclosed charges. Following her arrest,
she was held at several detention facilities,
sometimes in solitary confinement for months
at a time, and reportedly tortured and
otherwise ill-treated.
Mazen Darwish, Hani al-Zitani and Hussein
Gharir, activists from the independent Syrian
Center for Media and Freedom of Expression
(SCM), faced charges of “publicizing terrorist The death penalty remained in force for a
wide range of offences. No information was
available on death sentences handed down or
executions carried out during the year.

TAIWAN
Taiwan
Head of state: Ma Ying-jeou
Head of government: Ma Chi-kuo (replaced Jiang
Yi-huah in December)
While Taiwan took further steps to
implement international human rights
standards, serious concerns remained.
Notable among these were the right to
freedom of peaceful assembly, the death
penalty, torture and other ill-treatment,
housing and land rights, and gender
discrimination.
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
International groups of independent
experts reviewed national reports on the
Amnesty International Report 2014/15implementation of the ICCPR and ICESCR in
February 2013 and CEDAW in June 2014. In
September the government pledged to amend
228 laws and regulations to comply with
CEDAW. Laws were enacted to implement the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities by 2017.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
From 18 March to 10 April, hundreds of
students and other activists occupied the
Legislative Yuan (Parliament) to protest
against a trade deal with China. 1 On 23
March, a group of protesters forced their way
into the Executive Yuan (Cabinet) complex,
and a crowd gathered in the surrounding
areas. The police used excessive force while
dispersing them. To date there has been no
independent and impartial investigation into
the police conduct.
Over several subsequent months, over 200
protesters were summoned for questioning
under the Criminal Code and Assembly and
Parade Act; they remained under threat of
prosecution. At least 46 people who suffered
injuries during the protests filed a series of
private criminal lawsuits against the Premier
and high-ranking police officers. By the end
of the year, however, courts had declined to
hear two of these cases on the grounds that
they were too similar to one already under
court review.
DEATH PENALTY
Little progress was made towards the abolition
of the death penalty as Taiwan continued
to impose death sentences and carry out
executions. 2 In June the death sentence
was abolished for two crimes related to
kidnapping, but 55 offences remained
punishable by death.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In January, Taiwan abolished its military court
system during peacetime, including military
prisons. This followed the death of Corporal
Hung Chung-chiu in a military disciplinary
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
detention facility in July 2013. 3 In March,
a civilian court of first instance convicted
13 military officers of Hung Chung-chiu’s
death, sentencing them to between three
and eight months’ imprisonment; five others
were acquitted.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and lack
of adequate medical care remained serious
problems in prisons and detention centres.
An amendment to the Prison Camp Act,
aimed at addressing prison overcrowding
by expanding the use of minimum security
prisons, was enacted in June.
HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
Conflicts over housing and land rights
continued to increase due to rising land
prices and economic inequality. In July,
the land expropriation for the Taoyuan
Aerotropolis project, affecting an estimated
46,000 people, passed a key planning hurdle,
despite concerns of inadequate consultation
with residents as well as the indictment of a
key official for related corruption.
Indigenous Peoples’ rights
Concerns were raised about the use of
traditional lands of Indigenous Peoples for
tourism-related development.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Amendments to the Civil Code that would
enshrine marriage equality stalled in the
Legislative Yuan.
The Ministry of Interior failed to
put into effect the Ministry of Health’s
recommendation that genital surgery and
psychiatric evaluation should no longer be
needed to change one’s gender.

TAJIKISTAN
Republic of Tajikistan
Head of state: Emomali Rahmon
Head of government: Qokhir Rasulzoda
Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees
remained pervasive and impunity for crimes
of torture continued. The government
imposed further restrictions on the rights
to freedom of expression, association
and assembly.
BACKGROUND
Emomali Rahmon was re-elected as President
for a fourth term in November 2013 with
84.32% of the vote.
In May, three people were killed and five
injured when a police operation in Khorog,
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region
(GBAO), led to clashes between security
forces and residents. An investigation into the
incident was reported to be ongoing at the
end of the year. There was still no effective
investigation into the clashes in Khorog in July
2012, in which dozens of people and at least
22 civilians were killed. Reliable information
about the number of victims was still lacking.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Torture and other ill-treatment remained
widespread despite the adoption of an Action
Plan to implement recommendations by the
UN Committee against Torture in 2013.
Tajikistani NGOs documented 24 cases
of torture between 1 December 2013 and 8
360
October 2014. However, most relatives and
victims declined to pursue complaints for fear
of reprisals. Many more cases of torture were
likely to have gone unreported.
Criminal prosecutions against law
enforcement officials suspected of torture
were rare, and frequently terminated or
suspended before completion. By the
end of the year, only four security officers
had been convicted of torture since its
criminalization in 2012. Two of them were
given suspended sentences.
In April, the investigation into allegations
involving two officials suspected of torturing
Ismonboy Boboev (who died in custody
in February 2010) was suspended again,
reportedly due to the poor health of one of
the suspects.
Tajikistan failed to implement decisions by
UN bodies on individual cases. In June 2013,
the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention
urged the release of Ilhom Ismonov, who
had been arbitrarily detained, tortured and
forced to sign a false confession in November
2010. He remained in detention at the end of
the year.
Lawyers were repeatedly denied access
to their clients in detention, often for days
at a time. This was particularly common
in facilities run by the State Committee for
National Security.
Individuals perceived to be threats to
national security, including members of
religious movements and Islamist groups
or parties, were at particular risk of
incommunicado detention, torture and other
ill-treatment.
Umed Tojiev, a member of the opposition
Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP), died
in hospital on 19 January. He had been
arrested by police on 30 October 2013 in
Sughd region, and charged on 4 November
2013 with organizing a criminal group, but
was denied access to his lawyer until 13
November 2013. His family claimed he was
subjected to suffocation, sleep and food
deprivation and electric shocks. He jumped
out of the Sughd police station window on 5
Amnesty International Report 2014/15November 2013, breaking both his legs, but
was not provided with adequate medical care
until 4 January. His death, suspected to be
due to criminal negligence, was still under
investigation at the end of the year.
PRISON CONDITIONS
In February a monitoring group on detention
facilities established by the Human Rights
Ombudsman began its work. The group
included civil society representatives.
However, in some cases NGO representatives
were arbitrarily denied access to
detention facilities.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Politicians, civil society activists and
journalists were harassed for criticizing
the government.
In 2013-2014, some 15 lawsuits were
brought against journalists and media outlets,
including on charges of defamation and, in
one case, criminal fraud.
In February, journalist Olga Tutubalina and
newspaper Asia Plus were ordered by a court
to pay TJS 30,000 (US$6,300) in damages
to three plaintiffs for their “physical and
mental suffering” in connection with an article
published in 2013 which spoke unfavourably
of the “intelligentsia” and in which none of
the plaintiffs was mentioned.
Access to dozens of popular internet
resources, including news websites and
social media, was temporarily blocked
on multiple occasions during the year.
Reportedly, internet providers did so under
direct orders from the state regulator
Communications Service.
Reports abounded of politically motivated
harassment of opposition political leaders.
IRP members were particularly targeted. In
July 2013 the UN Human Rights Committee
expressed concern about the detention of
Zayd Saidov, the leader of the opposition
movement New Tajikistan. He was sentenced
in December 2013 to 26 years in prison. In
October 2014, the Supreme Court banned
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
the Group 24 opposition movement, declaring
it “extremist”.
On 16 June, Alexander Sodiqov, a
Tajikistani national studying for a PhD in
Canada, was detained in Khorog while
interviewing the deputy head of the opposition
Social Democratic party of GBAO as part of
his research on post-conflict. He was accused
of spying and remained incommunicado for
three days. On 19 June, the head of the State
Committee for National Security, Saimumin
Yatimov, stated in a thinly veiled reference to
his case, that foreign spies were operating in
Tajikistan under the guise of NGOs and trying
to undermine national security. Alexander
Sodiqov was a prisoner of conscience. He was
released on bail on 22 July and allowed to
travel to Canada on 10 September to continue
his studies.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
Human rights and other NGOs continued to
operate in an insecure environment and faced
pressure from the authorities. Unscheduled
inspections of NGOs increased, sometimes
followed by legal actions for alleged
infringements of the law.
On 24 June, the Constitutional Court
considered a submission by the Association
of Young Lawyers “Amparo” regarding
discrepancies between the law “On Public
Associations” and the Constitution. The
Court concluded that the law lacked clarity
on the grounds for closure of associations
and recommended that it be amended by
parliament. Amparo had been closed down
by the authorities in October 2012 for a minor
technical transgression. Its appeals against
this decision were unsuccessful.
361TANZANIA
United Republic of Tanzania
Head of state: Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete
Head of government: Mizengo Peter Pinda
Head of Zanzibar government: Ali Mohamed Shein
The constitutional review process continued,
although challenges threatened to hinder
the process. A Commission of Inquiry was
established to investigate human rights
abuses including at least 13 killings
committed by security agencies during
an anti-poaching operation conducted
in October 2013. People with albinism
remained at risk of being killed for their
body parts and violence against women
continued with impunity.
agencies during the operation. In June 2014,
President Kikwete, on the recommendation
of Parliament, established a Commission
of Inquiry with a three-month mandate to
investigate human rights abuses committed
during Operation Tokomeza. The Commission
of Inquiry started its work in mid-August
by visiting victims in affected regions.
The Commission had not completed its
investigations by the end of the year.
DISCRIMINATION – ATTACKS
ON PEOPLE WITH ALBINISM
There was one report of an albino person
who was killed for his body parts. At least five
attempted killings were reported. In one such
case, a man was killed as he defended his
spouse. The government’s efforts to prevent
human rights abuses against people with
albinism remained inadequate.
CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY
In February 2014, the Constituent Assembly
was inaugurated to discuss the draft
Constitution proposed by the Constitutional
Review Committee. Proceedings suffered a
setback in April when a coalition of opposition
parties walked out in protest, accusing the
ruling party of interfering with the process. In
October, the Constituent Assembly adopted
the draft Constitution amid claims by the
opposition and civil society groups that
the voting process was irregular. President
Kikwete announced that the constitutional
referendum would take place in April 2015
despite a September agreement by all
political parties to postpone it until after the
2015 elections. In June 2014, the African Court on Human
and Peoples’ Rights found that Tanzania
had violated the African Charter on
Human and Peoples’ Rights by prohibiting
individuals from contesting presidential and
parliamentary elections unless sponsored
by a political party. The Court directed
Tanzania to take constitutional and legislative
measures to remedy the violation, publish a
summary of the judgment within six months
in both English and Kiswahili languages,
and to publish the entire judgment on the
government’s website for one year. By the
end of the year, Tanzania had not reported to
the African Court on the measures taken to
comply with the judgment.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
In October 2013, security agencies including
the armed forces used excessive force
against civilians in an anti-poaching operation
called Operation Tokomeza. At least 13
civilians were killed and many more suffered
serious injuries. There were also reports
of torture, including rape, destruction of
property and killing of livestock by security Sexual and other forms of gender-based
violence, particularly domestic violence,
remained widespread. In the towns of Mbeya
and Geita alone, domestic violence resulted in
the deaths of 26 and 27 women respectively
during the first half of the year.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15THAILAND
Kingdom of Thailand
Head of state: King Bhumibol Adulyadej
Head of government: Prayuth Chan-ocha (replaced
Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan in May, who
replaced Yingluck Shinawatra in May)
formed the National Council for Peace and
Order (NCPO) and announced a reform
process and road map, with no clear date for
elections. After the promulgation of an interim
Constitution in July, the NCPO selected
a legislature, which elected NCPO leader
General Prayuth Chan-ocha as Prime Minister
in August. 1
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT
Political tensions prevailed through the year
and human rights protection weakened.
Armed violence continued in the southern
border provinces. Freedoms of expression,
association and peaceful assembly were
severely restricted, leading to the arbitrary
arrest of many individuals, some of whom
became prisoners of conscience.
BACKGROUND
Political deadlock between the government
and demonstrators dominated the first five
months of the year. The military staged a
coup in May. Martial law remained in place at
the end of the year.
The People’s Democratic Reform
Committee (PDRC), headed by the former
Democrat Deputy Prime Minister, led mass
demonstrations calling for the government
to be replaced by a people’s council to
implement political reforms. In March the
Constitutional Court ruled the February snap
elections invalid. The Electoral Commission
postponed polls scheduled for July on the
basis of ongoing political violence. The
opposition Democrat Party had boycotted
polls in February and PDRC protesters
impeded thousands of voters from casting
votes by blockading polling stations. In
May the Constitutional Court ordered Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step down,
and the National Anti-Corruption Commission
voted for her impeachment the following day.
On 20 May, the Commander-in-Chief of the
armed forces invoked martial law and seized
control of the country in a military coup on
22 May, suspending all but a few provisions
in the 2007 Constitution. The coup leaders
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Armed violence continued in the three
southern provinces of Pattani, Yala,
Narathiwat and parts of Songkhla.
Security forces were implicated in unlawful
killings, and torture and other ill-treatment.
In November the authorities announced the
provision of 2,700 semi-automatic assault
rifles to civilian paramilitary rangers.
Attacks targeting civilians were believed
to have been carried out by armed groups
through the year, including the bombing of
public places. Forty-two members of the
civilian administration and nine government
teachers were among 162 civilians killed. In
a number of instances assailants mutilated
the corpses by burning and beheading them.
Notes left at the scene in a number of attacks
presented the killings as acts of retaliation
for killings and arrests by government or
paramilitary forces. In November banners
were put up in all three provinces, criticizing
official policies and threatening further
killings of Buddhist civilians, bureaucrats and
teachers. In October six schools in Pattani
province were destroyed in arson attacks.
Two state-sponsored paramilitary rangers
admitted killing three ethnic Malay-Muslim
boys aged six, nine and 11, and wounding
their father and pregnant mother, in an attack
on the family’s home in Bacho, Narathiwat,
in February. One of the rangers said he
carried out the attack because of the lack of
progress on investigations into the murder of
his brother and sister-in-law in August 2013,
in which the children’s father, a suspected
insurgent, was implicated.
Between January and May, sporadic
clashes between supporters of the
363government and the PDRC, and targeted
attacks on demonstrations with weapons and
explosive devices, led to the deaths of 28
people and injuries to 825 others. 2 Targeted
attacks by unidentified individuals on
prominent politicians and commentators from
both sides were also carried out.
Suthin Tarathin, a prominent anti-
government protester, was shot dead on 26
January while marching with anti-government
protesters to prevent advance voting in the
Bang Na district of the capital, Bangkok.
The house of Somsak Jeamteerasakul, a
history professor and prominent commentator
on Thailand’s lese-majesty law, was attacked
by unknown assailants who fired gunshots
and threw homemade bombs at his home
and car on 12 February.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Allegations of torture and other ill-treatment
by police and armed forces continued
throughout the year, including during
incommunicado detention under martial law
provisions and by PDRC guards at political
demonstrations during the first half of
the year.
A bill criminalizing torture and enforced
disappearances remained in draft form at the
end of the year.
The UN Committee against Torture
expressed concern in May at the consistent
and widespread allegations of torture
and other ill-treatment in the country and
inadequate provisions for redress. 3
On 24 February, security guard Yuem Nillar
said he was detained at a protest site for five
days, tied up, denied food and beaten by two
PDRC guards before being thrown into a river.
In February the relatives of a soldier beaten
to death while attending a military training
camp in 2011 agreed a compensation
settlement of approximately 7 million baht
(some US$215,000). Private Wichean
Puaksom died as a result of torture after
taking leave without authorization.
364
ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
In April, environmental activist Pholachi
Rakchongcharoen was believed to have
been subjected to enforced disappearance
by officials in connection with his activities
to seek redress for human rights violations
in Kaengkrachan National Park, Petchaburi
Province. He was last seen on 17 April
after being detained and held in custody
by the National Park Chief and three other
park officials.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION
AND ASSEMBLY
Martial law orders imposed after the May
coup remained in place at the end of the
year. Freedoms of peaceful assembly
and expression were heavily restricted,
including a ban on “political” gatherings of
more than five people. Following the coup,
authorities blocked and shut down websites
and community radio stations for weeks or
months, and issued orders censoring media
criticism of the NCPO.
Protesters were prosecuted in military
courts for peaceful acts of protest in the
weeks following the coup, including holding
up a three-finger salute popularized in the
Hunger Games films. Arrests of peaceful
dissenters continued through the year.
Officials continued to restrict and cancel
private, public and academic meetings
and seminars following the coup, including
by arresting participants and requiring
individuals and organizations to seek official
approval in advance.
ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND DETENTIONS
Hundreds were subjected to arbitrary arrest
and detention under martial law powers,
including politicians, academics, journalists
and activists. The majority were held for up
to seven days without charge or trial after
being publicly ordered to report to military
authorities. Many were convicted of criminal
offences for failing to report. The majority
of those summoned were required to sign
undertakings not to engage in political
Amnesty International Report 2014/15activities as a condition of release. At the
end of the year officials continued to require
individuals, including students, lawyers
and civil society activists, to report to them
privately and to sign such undertakings.
Arrests, prosecutions and imprisonment
for acts of peaceful expression criminalized
under Article 112 of the Penal Code
– Thailand’s abusive lese-majesty law –
dramatically increased after the May coup;
there were at least 28 new arrests and eight
convictions. Lese-majesty detainees were
consistently denied bail in pre-trial detention
and during appeals after conviction. 4
Pornthip Mankong and Patiwat Saraiyam
were detained in August and charged with
lese-majesty for organizing and acting
in a play at Thammasat University in
October 2013.
UNFAIR TRIALS
The NCPO expanded the jurisdiction
of military courts to allow civilians to be
prosecuted for disobeying the orders of
the NCPO, offences against the monarchy,
and internal security. No right of appeal
was allowed.
IMPUNITY
No significant progress was made in
addressing widespread official impunity
for human rights violations. 5 The Interim
Constitution proclaimed in July provided
immunity to the NCPO and its agents
from criminal responsibility for human
rights violations.
On 28 August, the Criminal Court
dismissed murder charges against former
Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and his
deputy, Suthep Thaugsuban, for the deaths
of protesters during 2010. The Court ruled it
had no jurisdiction over the case.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Sweeping restrictions on freedom of
expression and other human rights under
martial law severely limited the work of
human rights defenders. Many faced human
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
rights violations as a result of their legitimate
activities, including enforced disappearance,
killings, attacks, 6 arbitrary arrests and
prosecution.
In May the Royal Thai Army lodged
a criminal complaint against Pornpen
Khongkachonkiet and her organization
Cross Cultural Foundation for “damaging
the reputation” of Taharn Pran Paramilitary
Unit 41, in Yala province, by requesting
an investigation into an allegation of
physical assault.
TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS
In June, Thailand was downgraded in the
US Department of State’s annual report on
Trafficking in Persons for failing to adequately
address persistent and widespread trafficking
of individuals for forced labour and the
sex trade.
Throughout the year hundreds of people,
including Rohingya from Myanmar, were
rescued from camps where they had been
held by smugglers in poor conditions for up to
six months and subjected to severe violence.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
In the absence of legal protection of the right
to asylum, refugees and asylum-seekers
remained at risk of arrest, arbitrary and
indefinite detention, deportation as illegal
immigrants and possible refoulement.
Immigration detainees, including refugees
recognized by UNHCR, the UN refugee
agency, continued to be held in poor
conditions in facilities not built for long-term
accommodation.
Fears of a crackdown on illegal labour led
to some 220,000 migrant workers, mostly
Cambodians, leaving the country in June;
many later returned.
DEATH PENALTY
Death sentences were handed down during
the year. There were no reported executions.
A pilot project begun in 2013 to remove
shackles from death row inmates in Bang
Kwang high security prison in Bangkok was
365ongoing. The project had not been extended
to other prisons by the end of the year.

IMPUNITY
Little progress was made in addressing crimes
against humanity and other human rights
violations committed by Indonesian security
forces and their auxiliaries from 1975 to
1999. Many suspected perpetrators remained
at large in Indonesia where they were safe
from prosecution. 1
In August, the Court of Appeal upheld
the sentence of a former AHI (Aileu
Hametin Integrasaun) militia member
imprisoned for crimes against humanity
committed in Aileu district around the 1999
independence referendum.
The Timorese government failed to
implement recommendations from the
Commission for Reception, Truth and
Reconciliation (CAVR) and the bilateral
Indonesia-Timor-Leste Commission of Truth
and Friendship (CTF) relating to impunity.
Parliament continued delaying consideration
of two draft laws providing for a National
Reparations Programme and establishment
of a “Public Memory Institute”, a body which
would implement the recommendations of
the CAVR and CTF, including the reparations
programme. A commission to examine

arrested and ill-treated dozens of individuals
in March allegedly linked to the two groups
KRM and CPD-RDTL. Concerns were raised
that the government may have violated
the rights to freedom of association and
expression by using parliament rather than
the courts to declare the organizations illegal.
In October, the Timor-Leste parliament
and government arbitrarily terminated the
contracts of foreign judicial officers and
advisors, raising serious concerns about
judicial independence and impacting
negatively on victims and their right to an
effective remedy. 2
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
The 2010 Law against Domestic Violence
continued to be used to prosecute cases
of domestic violence but many challenges
remained for victims seeking to access
justice. According to NGOs, courts tended
to hand down suspended prison sentences
or fines instead of imposing terms of
imprisonment.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION − MEDIA
In May, parliament passed a Media Law
which would impose severe restrictions on
journalists and on freedom of expression. In
August, the Court of Appeal found the law
unconstitutional and returned it to parliament
for review. 3 A revised law removing some
restrictions was approved by the President
in December.

TOGO
Togolese Republic
Head of state: Faure Gnassingbé
Head of government: Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu
The security forces repeatedly used
excessive force to disperse demonstrations.
Torture and other ill-treatment were used
to extract confessions from detainees,
and prisoners were denied timely medical
treatment. Threats to freedom of expression
persisted, with journalists targeted for ill-
treatment.
BACKGROUND
Elections which had been postponed
at least twice from October 2012 finally
took place in July 2013. President Faure
Gnassingbé’s party, Union for the Republic,
won an absolute majority. Opposition
parties protested at the results, which were
confirmed by the Constitutional Court.
Prime Minister Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu was
reappointed in September 2013.
In February 2013, the National Assembly
passed a law granting the High Authority
for Audiovisual and Communications
discretionary powers to impose sanctions
on the media without recourse to the
courts, prompting protests by journalists’
associations. The Constitutional Court ruled
367one month later that six articles of this law
were unconstitutional.
In February 2014, the National Assembly
rejected a government bill limiting the number
of Presidential mandates.
In July 2014, the National Assembly
approved the ratification of the International
Convention against enforced disappearance
without reservations.
Two major fires destroyed markets in Kara
and the capital, Lomé, in January 2013. Later
that month the National Assembly lifted the
immunity of Agbéyomé Kodjo, formerly Prime
Minister as well as President of the National
Assembly, to allow his arrest in connection
with the fires, along with other opposition
members. Agbéyomé Kodjo was released
in late February 2013 and Abass Kaboua,
President of the Movement of Centrist
Republicans, was released in September
2014. By the end of 2014, of 33 men
originally charged, 20 remained in detention.
A number of them were charged with
conspiracy to associate with criminal intent.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
In April 2013, two students were killed when
security forces shot live bullets at a crowd of
protesters in the northern town of Dapaong. 1
One of the victims, Anselme Sindare
Gouyano, was 12 years old. The government
announced that those responsible would
be brought to justice, but by the end of
2014 no investigations or prosecutions had
been started.
In November 2014, security forces
intervened near Aného, 45km from Lomé,
against the selling of prohibited petrol. When
the vendors resisted and threw stones,
security forces fired into the crowd. Ayovi
Koumako died after being shot and four other
people were injured. The Minister of Justice
issued a statement the same day stating that
an investigation would be opened.
detainees in pre-trial detention. Victims
included Mohamed Loum, arrested in the
market fires case, who was beaten and
subjected to waterboarding in gendarmerie
custody. He was also repeatedly subjected to
prolonged restraint in handcuffs, often lasting
24 hours, and denied food or water.
A group of men convicted in September
2011 of participating in a 2009 coup plot took
a complaint to the ECOWAS court, claiming
they had been tortured during interrogations.
In July 2013, the ECOWAS court found
that the Togolese state was responsible for
acts of torture and ordered reparations for
the victims. The National Human Rights
Commission of Togo had also found that
these detainees had been subjected to
inhuman and degrading acts of violence in
February 2012. It recommended that the
government impose exemplary punishments
on all those who had participated, directly or
indirectly. The government did not deny the
torture allegations and reparations were paid
to each of the plaintiffs in this case. Apart
from transferring those responsible for the
torture to other duties, no action was taken to
investigate and prosecute the perpetrators.
Three members of this group – Adjinon
Kossi Lambert, Towbeli Kouma and Pali
Afeignindou – were pardoned in February
2013. Seven others, including Kpatcha
Gnassingbé, brother of the President,
Captain Kokou Tchaa Dontema and former
Gendarmerie Lieutenant Efoé Sassouvi
Sassou, remained in prison throughout 2014.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Denial of or delays in providing health care
continued to put prisoners’ lives at risk.
Etienne Yakanou Kodjo, a member of the
opposition National Alliance for Change, died
in prison after being refused timely medical
care in May 2013. No investigation had been
opened into his death by the end of 2014.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Torture and other ill-treatment was used
by members of the security forces against Threats to freedom of expression continued.
Journalists were injured by police officers
368
Amnesty International Report 2014/15while covering protests and were targeted
with tear gas and bullets. In March 2013,
journalist Zeus Aziadouvo, who had reported
on the use of torture in the market fires case,
was charged with complicity in the case.
A radio station – Radio Légende FM – was
closed down by police in July 2013.
Student associations were forbidden from
demonstrating. The Association of Victims
of Torture in Togo (ASVITTO) was also
forbidden from holding sit-ins. A sit-in protest
in March 2014 to claim reparations ordered
by the ECOWAS court in the case of the men
convicted of participating in a 2009 coup
plot (see above) was dispersed with tear gas.
Reparations were paid later that month.
Amah Olivier, President of the ASVITTO,
was arrested in September 2013 and
charged with incitement to rebellion for
speaking about the political situation during a
demonstration. He was conditionally released
in February 2014 but was again summoned
by the investigating judge in September. He
reportedly received death threats in detention.

Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
A second round of consultations on the
reform of the Constitution was carried out in
2014, following a report by the Constitution
Reform Commission and nationwide
consultations in 2013.
The country continued to face a serious
public security crisis: homicide rate remained
at a high level with 403 murders reported
by the police compared with 407 in 2013.
In response, joint police and military patrols
were deployed. In August 2014 the army’s
Defence Force Reserves were called to assist
with street patrolling until 7 January 2015,
despite serious concerns that the force was
not trained to carry out these duties.
Prosecutor and senior attorney Dana
Seetahal was assassinated by unidentified
men in May 2014. She had been investigating
high-profile cases including the kidnapping
and murder of a businesswoman. An
investigation into her killing was immediately
opened by the authorities.
In August, pre-trial detainees in two prisons
went on hunger strike to protest against the
slow progress of their cases in the courts.
According to the International Centre for
Prison Studies, 43% of the prison population
was in pre-trial detention.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Reports of killings by the security forces
suggested that they may have been unlawful
and contradicted the official claims of
“exchange of gunfire” with criminal elements.
Hakeem Alexander, 16, and his cousin
Tevin Alexander, 15, were killed on 9 June
2014 in Morvant, Port of Spain, when police
were called to intervene in a shoot-out.
Eyewitnesses alleged that the two boys were
executed by police officers while on their
knees with their hands up. An investigation
into the incident was ongoing at the end of
the year.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
In December 2013, Jameson John allegedly
suffered burns to his torso, leg and genitals
369while in police custody. Six police officers
were charged with misconduct and were
awaiting trial at the end of the year.
DEATHS IN CUSTODY
On 24 June, Jahwi Ghany died in police
custody in Chaguanas. A first autopsy stated
he had died from heart failure. A second
autopsy ordered by his family found that
his death had been caused by trauma to
the head. An investigation by the Police
Complaint Authority was ongoing at the end
of the year.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Although the Constitution Reform Commission
recognized in 2013 the “high level of violence
and abuse against LGBTI [people]”, it failed
to formulate recommendations towards
achieving equality and ending discrimination.
Laws criminalizing same-sex consensual acts
and barring homosexuals from entering the
country remained in place.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty continued to be mandatory
for murder and death sentences were handed
down. No executions have taken place since
1999. The 2013 report of the Constitution
Reform Commission recommended the
retention of the death penalty. In December,
in response to the high homicide rate, Prime
Minister Persad-Bissessar announced that
she will seek to introduce new legislation to
facilitate the resumption of executions.
370
TUNISIA
Republic of Tunisia
Head of state: Beji Caid Essebsi (replaced Moncef
Marzouki in December)
Head of government: Mehdi Jomaa
A new Constitution adopted in January
contained important human rights
guarantees, but the authorities continued
to restrict freedoms of expression and
association. There were new reports of
torture of detainees and at least two
people were victims of apparently unlawful
killings by police. The new Constitution
contained improved safeguards for women’s
rights but failed to end legal and other
discrimination against women or to address
violence against women. A new process
was established to address past human
rights violations; however, a military appeals
court significantly reduced the sentences
of former senior officials convicted of
responsibility for hundreds of unlawful
killings during the 2010-2011 uprising.
Tunisia kept its borders open to refugees
fleeing fighting in Libya. Armed groups
carried out attacks and killed members
of the security forces. At least two people
were sentenced to death; there were
no executions.
BACKGROUND
Following the political crisis in 2013 sparked
by the assassinations in February and July of
two left-wing politicians, Chokri Belaid and
Mohamed Brahmi, Tunisia’s political parties
reached an agreement that resulted in a new
Constitution and the appointment of a new
interim government in early 2014. The new
government lifted the state of emergency, in
force since 2011, on 5 March.
On 26 January, the National Constituent
Assembly (NCA) adopted a new Constitution
by a large majority after months of deadlock
and an agreement by NCA members to reach
Amnesty International Report 2014/15a consensus on the most contentious issues.
Three days later a new interim government
took office pending legislative elections
in October and presidential elections in
November. The new Constitution guaranteed
key human rights, including freedoms
of expression and assembly; freedom of
association, including the right to form
political parties; freedom of movement; the
right to citizenship; and the right to bodily
integrity. It also guaranteed freedom from
arbitrary detention, rights to fair trial and to
political asylum, and prohibited torture and
the use of any statute of limitations to prevent
prosecutions for torture. Other articles, such
as one prohibiting “attacks on the sacred”,
were more problematic, carrying a potential
threat to free speech. The Constitution failed
to abolish the death penalty.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The government submitted a new 163-article
draft law to amend the 2003 Anti-terrorism
Law to the NCA, which began discussing it in
August. The new law aims to remove some of
the most draconian features of the 2003 law.
In October, Prime Minister Jomaa said
that the authorities had arrested over 1,500
suspected “terrorists” since the beginning of
the year.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
There were new reports of torture of detainees
in police custody, mostly in the first few days
after arrest and during interrogation. There
was at least one suspicious death in custody.
The law allowed police to hold detainees in
pre-arraignment detention for up to six days
without access to lawyers or relatives.
Following a visit to Tunisia in June, the
UN Special Rapporteur on torture expressed
concern that torture and other ill-treatment
was continuing, and noted the low rate of
successful prosecutions of perpetrators.
In 2013, the NCA adopted legislation to
create a 16-member National Body for the
Prevention of Torture, empowered to inspect
detention facilities without first obtaining
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
consent, except when urgent or compelling
reasons prohibit it. By the end of the year,
however, the National Body had yet to be
established.
The death in hospital on 3 October of
Mohamed Ali Snoussi, nine days after his
arrest, drew renewed attention to police
violence against suspects and the authorities’
continuing failure to address it. Witnesses
saw him being dragged from his house in
handcuffs, beaten, stripped naked and taken
away by masked police officers, who were
heard to say that they belonged to the Brigade
17 police unit. Mohamed Ali Snoussi’s wife
said that she briefly saw him once in police
detention, when he had visible marks of
beatings but appeared too afraid to say how
he had sustained them. When his family
received his body it bore bruises and other
injuries to the head, shoulders, back, testicles
and feet. The Ministry of the Interior said that
he had been arrested on drugs charges and
that an autopsy concluded that his death
was not caused by violence, but failed to
give the autopsy report to the family despite
their requests.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Police officers shot and killed two women,
Ahlem Dalhoumi and Ons Dalhoumi, on the
night of 23 August as they drove home in
the city of Kasserine with family members.
The shooting occurred when police officers
dressed in black, whom the car’s occupants
apparently assumed were armed robbers,
signalled to them to stop, then opened fire
as they drove on, killing the two women and
injuring a third. The authorities said that
police officers opened fire when the car
ignored their order to stop and sped towards
them. The surviving car occupants said
the police did not identify themselves and
opened fire without warning. The Ministry of
the Interior stated in October that it had not
suspended the police officers nor opened an
administrative investigation, despite public
announcements to the contrary.
371TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
Following the adoption of a Transitional
Justice law in December 2013, a Truth and
Dignity Commission was established in June
to investigate human rights violations and
arbitrate on cases of official corruption since
1 July 1955. An independent body, the
Commission was also mandated to provide
both material and symbolic reparations to
victims and to draft recommendations to
prevent the recurrence of human rights
violations and the misuse of public funds and
to promote democracy. The Commission,
which has a four-year mandate extendable for
up to one year, began its work in December
after developing its rules and methods
of operation.
The Transitional Justice law also provided
for the establishment of Special Judicial
Chambers to investigate and prosecute
human rights violations committed by state
agents between July 1955 and December
2013. In March, the Ministry of Justice
appointed a technical committee to draft a
decree on how these specialized chambers
would function.
In April, the authorities released some
of the former senior officials imprisoned
in connection with the unlawful killings of
protesters during the 2010-2011 uprising
after the Military Court of Appeal amended
the charges on which they had previously
been convicted by military courts and
reduced their sentences. Those released
included former Minister of the Interior Rafiq
Haj Kacem, whose 12-year sentence was
reduced to a three-year term, including time
spent in custody awaiting trial. Several family
members of people killed or injured during
the uprising went on hunger strike in protest.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION
AND ASSOCIATION
The authorities restricted freedoms of
expression and association on counter-
terrorism grounds following an armed group
attack on 17 July that killed 15 government
soldiers in Mount Chaambi, near the border
372
with Algeria. The authorities ordered the
immediate closure of all unauthorized radio
and television stations, mosques and social
media websites, suspended the activities
of organizations deemed to have links with
terrorism, and threatened to prosecute
anyone who called Tunisia’s military and
security institutions into question. On 22
July, a government spokesperson said the
authorities had suspended 157 organizations
and two radio stations for alleged links to
terrorist groups and for promoting violence.
The executive authorities took this action
despite Decree Law no. 2011-88 of 2011,
which states that organizations may only be
suspended pursuant to a judicial decision.
Jabeur Mejri, a blogger sentenced to a
prison term in 2012 after being convicted
of posting material online deemed insulting
to Islam and the Prophet Mohamed, was
released on 4 March. In April, he received
a new eight-month prison sentence arising
from an argument with a court official,
but was released on 14 October under a
presidential pardon.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Discrimination against women continued
in law and practice. Tunisia officially lifted
its reservations to CEDAW on 23 April;
however, the government maintained a
general declaration that it would take no
organizational or legislative action required
by CEDAW if it conflicted with Tunisia’s
Constitution.
The new Constitution adopted in January
provided improved safeguards for women’s
rights, but women remained subject to
discrimination under laws relating to
family matters such as inheritance and
child custody.
Article 46 of the Constitution afforded
women greater protection against violence,
but the Penal Code remained problematic,
particularly its Article 227bis which allowed
men who rape girls or women under the age
of 20 to escape prosecution if they marry
their victim. In June, the Secretary of State for
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Women and Family said that the government
planned to draft a framework law combating
violence against women and girls with the
assistance of an expert committee.
In March, a court sentenced two police
officers to seven-year prison terms after
convicting them of raping a woman in
September 2012; a third police officer was
sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for
taking her fiancé to a cash machine and
trying to extort money from him. During the
trial, defence lawyers accused the victim
of indecency and offering sexual favours to
the police after they found her alone with
her fiancé. She lodged an appeal against
the sentences on account of their relative
leniency. In November the two officers
convicted of rape had their sentences
increased to 15-year prison terms on appeal;
the third officer’s sentence was confirmed
on appeal.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Thousands of Libyans and other nationals
reportedly crossed into Tunisia in July and
August to escape fighting between rival armed
militias in Libya. The authorities kept Tunisia’s
border with Libya open while warning that
they would close it if the security or economic
situation deteriorated. Properly documented
Libyans were allowed to enter and remain in
Tunisia but nationals of some other countries
were allowed to enter Tunisia for transit only.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty remained in force for
murder and other crimes; no executions have
been carried out since 1991. At least two
people were sentenced to death and at least
three prisoners had their death sentences
commuted during the year.
In November, Tunisia voted for a UN
General Assembly resolution calling for a
worldwide moratorium on the death penalty.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
TURKEY
Republic of Turkey
Head of state: Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (replaced
Abdullah Gül in August)
Head of government: Ahmet Davutoğlu (replaced
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in August)
Following the 2013 Gezi protests and the
rupture with former ally Fethullah Gülen,
the authorities became more authoritarian in
responding to critics. They undermined the
independence of the judiciary, introduced
new restrictions on internet freedoms
and handed unprecedented powers to the
country's intelligence agency. The rights of
peaceful demonstrators were violated and
police officers enjoyed near-total impunity
for the use of excessive force. Unfair trials
continued, especially under anti-terrorism
laws, but the excessive use and length of
pre-trial detention declined. The authorities
ignored the rights of conscientious objectors
and of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and intersex people and failed to take
necessary steps to prevent violence against
women. By the end of the year, 1.6 million
Syrian refugees were living in Turkey, many
of them destitute.
BACKGROUND
The authorities acted to crush a criminal
investigation into alleged corruption within
the inner circle of Prime Minister Erdoğan
that became public on 17 December 2013.
Police officers and prosecutors working on
the case were transferred to other duties.
The investigation was formally closed by
prosecutors on 16 October 2014. The
government branded the investigation
a plot by supporters of influential cleric,
Fethullah Gülen. The authorities vowed to
take further action against Fethullah Gülen
and his network of supporters in the police
and judiciary.
373In April, Parliament passed legislative
amendments granting the National
Intelligence Agency (MIT) unprecedented
powers of surveillance and its officials near
total immunity from prosecution.
In Soma, western Turkey, 301 miners
died following an explosion at a coal mine in
May. This latest disaster shone a spotlight on
industrial safety in a country with one of the
highest numbers of work-related deaths in
the world.
The convictions of military officers for
plotting to overthrow the AK Party government
in the “Sledgehammer” case were overturned
by the Constitutional Court on 18 June
2014, and sent for retrial. The “Ergenekon”
prosecution against civilians accused
of plotting to overthrow the government
continued. Many of the defendants were
released on the grounds that their detention
had exceeded the maximum five-year
term. Other defendants were released
following rulings by the Constitutional Court.
Prosecutions targeting Kurdish political
activists for alleged membership of the
PKK-linked Kurdistan Communities Union
carried on across the country, but many of
the defendants were released from pre-
trial detention.
In August, the serving Prime Minister
became Turkey’s first directly elected
President, bringing far greater power and
influence to the role in practice, if not in law.
In October, 49 hostages taken from
Turkey’s consulate in Mosul, Iraq, were
released after three months by the Islamic
State armed group. The government refused
to disclose what was provided to the armed
group. It was alleged that 180 prisoners
in Turkey were released in exchange for
the hostages.
The two-year-old peace process between
the authorities and the PKK continued but
looked shakier than ever in the face of armed
clashes, spillover from the conflicts in Syria
and Iraq and lack of any concrete progress.
374
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Criminal prosecutions threatening freedom
of expression continued to be brought
against journalists, activists and other
dissenting voices, despite the adoption of
legislative amendments intended to improve
the law in 2013. Alongside anti-terrorism
provisions, laws on defamation and provoking
religious hatred were frequently used. The
independence of the mainstream media
continued to be undermined by its close
business links with the government. More
independent-minded journalists were forced
out of their jobs by editors fearful of upsetting
government and media owners. Press Law
gagging orders were used to ban the reporting
of several news stories, including the
capture of 49 hostages from Turkey’s Mosul
consulate, on “national security grounds”.
In March, the Parliament passed draconian
amendments to the Internet Law increasing
the authorities’ powers to ban or block
content and threatening users’ privacy.
Following the amendments, the authorities
used administrative orders to block access
to Twitter and YouTube after the social media
sites were used to post items embarrassing to
the government ahead of the local elections
in March. Despite court orders requiring the
lifting of the bans, the sites remained blocked
for two weeks and two months respectively
until the Constitutional Court ruled that the
blocking order be lifted.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
The rights of peaceful demonstrators were
denied by the authorities, with protests
banned, prevented or dispersed with the
use of excessive, unnecessary and often
punitive force by police officers. People
who attended demonstrations deemed
unlawful by the authorities faced prosecution,
often on trumped-up charges of violent
conduct. The restrictive Law on Meetings
and Demonstrations continued to be a
barrier to freedom of peaceful assembly,
despite superficial amendments in March. It
unfairly restricted the time and location that
Amnesty International Report 2014/15assemblies could take place, while requiring
overly burdensome notification from the
organizers and discounted any possibility of
spontaneous demonstrations.
On 1 May, 39,000 police and 50 water
cannon vehicles were used to prevent
trade unionists and others from marching
on Taksim Square, the traditional location
for May Day demonstrations. May Day
demonstrations had taken place in Taksim
Square for several years. In 2013 and 2014
they were banned and clashes ensued
between police and demonstrators trying to
reach the square. The authorities announced
that Taksim would be permanently off-limits
for all large demonstrations and instead
offered two locations outside the centre of the
city where demonstrations could take place.
This policy was replicated in other cities
across Turkey.
In June, the trial of members of Taksim
Solidarity, an umbrella group of more than
100 organizations, set up to contest the
redevelopment of Gezi Park and Taksim
Square, started in Istanbul. Five prominent
members stood accused of “founding a
criminal organization”, punishable by up to
15 years in prison, while all 26 defendants
were charged with “refusing to disperse from
an unauthorized demonstration” under the
Law on Meetings and Demonstrations. The
trial was continuing at the end of the year. 1
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Reported cases of torture in official places
of detention remained far fewer than in
previous years. More than two years after
the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the
UN Convention against Torture, the required
domestic implementing mechanism had not
been established. The National Human Rights
Institution was earmarked by the authorities
for this role but lacked the necessary skills,
resources and guarantees of independence
to fulfil it.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Excessive and abusive force by police officers
during demonstrations, including the firing of
tear gas canisters directly at demonstrators
from close range, and the use of water
cannon and beatings of peaceful protesters,
remained common. Ministry of Interior
guidelines, introduced in June and July 2013
to combat excessive and unnecessary force,
were mostly ignored.
In a number of cases, police used live
ammunition during demonstrations, resulting
in deaths and injury.
IMPUNITY
Investigations into abuses by public officials
remained ineffective, and the chance of
securing justice for the victims remote. In the
absence of the long-promised but never-
established independent police complaints
mechanism, police units were effectively
responsible for investigating their own alleged
abuses under the instruction of under-
resourced prosecutors. Police departments
routinely failed to provide the most basic
items of evidence to investigations.
No prosecution was opened against six
police officers who were filmed with a camera
phone beating Hakan Yaman and dragging
him onto a fire, close to the scene of a Gezi
Park demonstration in Istanbul in June 2013. 2
In the attack, Hakan Yaman lost his sight
in one eye and suffered burns and broken
bones for which he underwent six operations.
At the end of the year, police departments
had failed to provide the investigation with
CCTV footage from the area and photographs
of police officers on duty at the time. A
parallel administrative investigation concluded
without result on the grounds that the police
officers could not be identified, despite the
number of the water cannon vehicle that they
were operating being clearly visible in mobile
phone footage.
In October, more than 40 people were
killed and scores injured in the predominately
Kurdish area of southeastern Turkey, during
clashes between rival groups and with the
375police, after protests erupted against the
Islamic State armed group assault on the
Kurdish city of Kobani in Syria. There were
numerous reports of the failure to conduct
prompt crime scene investigations or to
question alleged perpetrators of attacks on
rival groups.
In Siirt, Davut Naz died at the scene of
a Kobani-related protest on 8 October. The
provincial governor said in a statement that
he had been killed by demonstrators and
died of a neck injury while eyewitnesses
reported that he was shot by police officers
with live ammunition. His family reported
that there were three gunshot wounds but
no neck injury to the body. No crime scene
investigation was conducted and the criminal
investigation into the incident had not
progressed by the end of the year.
UNFAIR TRIALS
Legislative amendments in July abolished
the anti-terrorism and organized crime courts
with special powers, but those accused
of terrorism-related offences still risked
conviction without substantive and convincing
evidence in ordinary courts. Legislative
amendments in 2013, imposing a maximum
limit of five years for pre-trial detention and
introducing greater protections against its
unfair use, yielded results and resulted in
fewer people being held and for less time.
The independence of the judiciary was
undermined by changes to the top judicial
body, the Higher Council of Judges and
Prosecutors, that granted greater powers
to the Minister of Justice, and allowed
the transfer of hundreds of judges and
prosecutors.
HOUSING RIGHTS
The central government and municipalities
controlled by all the main political parties
carried out urban transformation projects
that failed to uphold the right of residents to
adequate consultation, compensation or the
provision of alternative housing.
376
Residents in Sarıgöl, a poor district of
Istanbul with a significant Roma population,
were forcibly evicted from their homes in a
project to replace shanty houses with higher
quality residential blocks. The cost of the new
houses was vastly higher than the majority of
residents could afford and the compensation
for those who lost their houses was
inadequate. Many of the families threatened
with homelessness by the project did not have
title deeds for the land despite living in the
neighbourhood for generations.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
The implementation of the 2012 Law
on Protection of Family and Prevention
of Violence against Women remained
inadequate, under-resourced and ineffective
in dealing with domestic violence. A number
of women under judicial protection were
reported to have been killed. The number
of shelters for victims of domestic violence
remained far below that required by law.
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS
At the end of the year, the government
estimated that there were 1.6 million Syrian
refugees in the country, up from 700,000 in
January. 3 The bulk of the financial burden
was borne by the Turkish authorities with little
assistance from the international community.
More than 220,000 were accommodated
in well-resourced, government-run refugee
camps, but many of the more than 1.3 million
refugees living outside camps were destitute
and received little or no assistance. Despite
Turkey’s professed “open border policy”,
there were persistent reports of unlawful or
abusive force by Turkish border guards at
unofficial crossing points, including the use
of live ammunition, beatings and pushing
refugees back into war-torn Syria.
An estimated 30,000 Yezidi Kurdish
refugees arrived from Iraq in August, but
unlike the Syrians, they were not afforded a
“temporary protection status”, nor the rights
and entitlements it brings. The Yezidi refugees
joined an estimated 100,000 asylum-seekers

processing of their asylum claims. 1. Gezi Park protests: Brutal denial of the right to peaceful assembly in

Turkey did not recognize the right to
conscientious objection to military service
despite the explicit rulings from the European
Court of Human Rights requiring it to do so.
Instead, the authorities continued repeatedly
to prosecute conscientious objectors for
“desertion” and other similar offences.
In October, a military court convicted
56-year-old conscientious objector Ali
Fikri Işık on three counts of desertion,
sentencing him to 25 months in prison
or a fine of 15,200 liras (US$6,725). His
“desertion” related to his refusal, for reasons
of conscience, to carry out military service
during the 1980s. At 56 he was too old to
serve and had already been considered “unfit
for military service” by the military authorities.
An appeal remained pending at the military
Supreme Court of Appeals at the end of
the year.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and intersex people continued to face
discrimination in employment and in
interactions with the state authorities. No
progress was made in bringing provisions to
prohibit discrimination on grounds of sexual
orientation and gender identity into the
Constitution or into domestic law. A number of
murders of transgender women were reported
during the year.
The trial for the murder of Ahmet Yıldız, a
gay man killed in a suspected honour killing
in July 2008, failed to make any progress
during 2014, with his father, the single
suspect in the case, remaining at large. The
authorities had failed to investigate death
threats against Ahmet Yıldız ahead of the
murder and to launch a prompt, effective
investigation following the killing.

TURKMENISTAN
Turkmenistan
Head of state and government: Gurbanguly
Berdimuhamedov
Despite improvements to laws on the
media and political participation,
opposition figures, journalists and human
rights defenders continued to suffer
harassment by the authorities. Judicial
independence was limited; there were
no meaningful appeals procedures, and
acquittals in criminal trials were rare.
Lawyers trying to work independently risked
disbarment. Torture and other ill-treatment
remained widespread.
BACKGROUND
In September 2013 Turkmenistan accepted
recommendations from the UN Human
Rights Council to co-operate with UN
special procedures. However, the authorities
severely restricted access to the country
for international monitors. Turkmenistan
did not respond to requests from Amnesty
International to visit and there were 10
outstanding requests for visits from UN
special procedures.
In the first multi-party elections in
Turkmenistan, the opposition Party of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs won
parliamentary seats in December 2013.
377However, observers reported that this party
did not represent a genuine challenge to the
political leadership and that it proclaimed its
loyalty to President Berdimuhamedov.
Since the passing of the Law on Mass Media
on 4 January 2013, principles of media
independence and the prohibition on state
interference in media activities have been
enshrined in law. Yet in practice, censorship
remained extensive and newspapers were
owned by ministries that answered to the
President. No genuinely independent
newspapers had been registered under the
new law by the end of the year. In practice,
people were barred from subscribing to
foreign media outlets and access to the
internet was monitored and restricted. Social
networking websites were frequently blocked.
Human rights activists and journalists
in Turkmenistan and in exile came under
consistent pressure from the Turkmenistani
authorities. methods such as pulling of the genitals with
pliers, electric shocks, and beatings with
chair legs and plastic bottles filled with water.
Reports on prisons included a prisoner being
forced to swallow pills and having threats
made against his family; incidents of forced
rape between prisoners; and shackling of
prisoners serving life sentences.
In January, Geldy Kyarizov, his wife,
sister-in-law and 12-year-old daughter were
detained by security officers as they tried to
travel to seek medical attention. They were
held for questioning, subjected to ill-treatment
and made to sign a paper saying that they
would not lodge an official compliant. 1
Activist Mansur Mingelov went on hunger
strike in prison from 19 May until 8 June to
demand a retrial. 2 He had been sentenced
to 22 years’ imprisonment after an unfair
trial shortly after collating and passing to the
Prosecutor General and foreign diplomats
information about torture and ill-treatment
of the Baloch ethnic community in Mary
province in 2012.
FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
Unreasonable state interference in public
associations’ activities continued. A
Presidential decree in place since January
2013 required foreign grants to be registered
with and approved by the government.
Funding of activities deemed “political”
was prohibited, as was membership of
an unregistered association. The Law
on Public Associations came into force
in May, prohibiting state interference in
associations, but also providing for substantial
powers of official monitoring and oversight.
Registration procedures for associations
remained complicated. No organizations
in Turkmenistan were openly engaged in
independent human rights monitoring or
social or political commentary. During the 2013 UN Universal Periodic
Review on Turkmenistan, the state rejected
recommendations from the UN Human
Rights Council to provide information on the
whereabouts of prisoners who were subjected
to enforced disappearance after an alleged
assassination attempt on then President
Saparmurat Niyazov in November 2002.
Non-governmental sources reported that at
least eight of those convicted had died in
detention. The families of the disappeared
continued to be denied all contact with their
loved ones and any official information about
their fate or whereabouts for over a decade.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Credible reports of torture and other ill-
treatment by security forces against people
suspected of criminal offences included
378
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
Although Turkmenistan ended the use of the
exit visa system in 2006, in practice arbitrary
restrictions on the right to travel abroad for
those who have fallen out of favour with the
authorities continued.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 10 April, Ruslan Tukhbatullin was
prevented from leaving Turkmenistan to meet
his brother Farid Tukhbatullin and was told
he and his nine-year-old son were blacklisted
for travelling abroad. This was believed to be
in retaliation for Farid Tukhbatullin’s human
rights work. 3
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
Religious activity remained strictly controlled.
Religious groups representing Shi’a Muslims,
Catholics, Protestants and Jehovah’s
Witnesses faced difficulty in registering
organizations. Six Jehovah’s Witnesses
imprisoned for conscientious objection were
released in an amnesty in October. One
remained in prison. Provisions in the Code
of Administrative Offences, which came into
force in January, punished the import, export
and distribution of religious materials.
space. Discrimination, harassment and
violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people
increased. Violence against women
remained widespread while state hostility
increased towards civil society organizations
and activists working on human rights, oil
governance, corruption and land issues.
BACKGROUND
The succession of President Museveni as
leader of the National Resistance Movement
(NRM) and head of state dominated national
discourse during 2014. In February the NRM
passed a resolution urging party members
to endorse President Museveni as sole
candidate in the 2016 presidential elections.
The resolution also discouraged leaders
within the party from harbouring presidential
ambitions. In September, Health Minister
Ruhakana Rugunda replaced Amama
Mbabazi as Prime Minister.

Restrictions on freedoms of expression,

continued as the authorities used repressive
and discriminatory legislation to stifle civil
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION
Restrictions on freedom of expression,
peaceful assembly and association continued.
The Public Order Management Act (POMA),
which came into force in November 2013,
was used to impose wide-ranging restrictions
on public meetings. It gave the police powers
to prohibit and disperse public gatherings
of a political nature. A petition challenging
the POMA’s constitutionality filed with the
Constitutional Court in December 2013
remained pending.
The POMA was used in the first quarter
of 2014 to disperse peaceful assemblies
organized as part of the Free and Fair
Elections Now campaign and arrest political
activists. Often, those arrested were not
charged. In April, the Free and Fair Elections
Now campaign steering team held a meeting
with the Minister of Internal Affairs. The police
did not interrupt subsequent rallies convened
by the group.
On 26 February, police declared illegal and
dispersed a peaceful protest organized by the
379End Miniskirt Harassment Coalition outside
the National Theatre in the capital, Kampala.
On 22 March in Mbale city, the police used
tear gas and fired live ammunition into the
air to disperse crowds of people who were
marching to the venue of a rally organized by
the Free and Fair Elections Now campaign
team. Police said that the rally’s organizers
had not given the notification required under
the POMA.
On 27 March, the police prevented Bishop
Zac Niringiye, the retired Assistant Bishop of
Kampala and anti-corruption activist, from
speaking at Kabale University in western
Uganda and participating in a scheduled
broadcast on Kabale’s Voice of Kigezi radio
station. Police told Amnesty International
that they acted because Bishop Zac had not
received authorization from the university
to hold a meeting on its premises and the
scheduled radio show could incite violence.
During the year the police stopped peaceful
demonstrations by a group of unemployed
young people referring to themselves as
the Jobless Brotherhood. On 17 June,
two members of the Jobless Brotherhood,
Norman Tumuhimbise and Robert Mayanja,
were arrested after they entered Parliament
with two piglets to protest against corruption
and high youth unemployment. They were
later charged with criminal trespass among
other charges. On 4 August, nine members
of the Jobless Brotherhood, carrying a coffin,
were arrested as they demonstrated at the
Independence Monument in Kampala. They
were charged with participating in an unlawful
assembly. In October, Norman Tumuhimbise
and Robert Mayanja were arrested following
another demonstration in Kampala
involving piglets.
In June, the High Court issued its judgment
in a case challenging the constitutionality
of the February 2012 forced closure of
an LGBTI activists’ workshop in the town
of Entebbe by the Minister of Ethics and
Integrity. The applicants argued that the
Minister’s action violated their rights including
freedom of expression, peaceful assembly
380
and association. The High Court ruled that
the applicants had not suffered any unlawful
infringement of their rights and that they
had participated in promoting “homosexual
practices” which were offences against
morality under the Penal Code.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
In February, President Museveni signed the
2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill into law. In
August, the Constitutional Court declared
the law null and void on the grounds that
there was no quorum in Parliament when it
was passed. Discrimination, arbitrary arrests,
harassment and violence against LGBTI
people increased during the five months that
the Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) was in
force. LGBTI support organizations observed
a sharp increase in the number of arrests of
LGBTI people under the AHA. Some LGBTI
people were arrested by police when reporting
a crime or when visiting a friend or colleague
in detention. Many were held without charge
for longer than the 48-hour maximum
stipulated by the Constitution. Those arrested
reported ill-treatment in detention, including
being subjected to physical and sexual
assaults, stripping, groping and forced anal
examinations. A number of transgender
individuals were stripped naked and paraded
by the police in front of the media. Some
HIV-positive detainees were denied access to
anti-retroviral medication.
The authorities also targeted organizations
providing services to LGBTI people.
In March, the authorities suspended the
work of the Refugee Law Project (RLP) in
refugee camps and settlements pending
investigations into allegations that the
organization was “promoting homosexuality“,
an offence under the AHA.
In May, the suspension was extended to
cover all RLP work relating to refugees and
asylum-seekers. The suspension continued
to stand even after the Constitutional Court
nullified the AHA.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 3 April, police raided the Makerere
University Walter Reed Project, an HIV
research project run in partnership between
Makerere University and the US Military
HIV Research Program. One employee was
taken into custody on suspicion of “recruiting
homosexuals” but was subsequently released.
The clinic was temporarily closed.
The AHA legitimized abuses and violence
against LGBTI people by non-state actors
whose actions went largely unpunished. One
transgender woman was killed and another
raped. Evictions, threats and blackmail were
the most common abuses against LGBTI
people. Increased threat levels for LGBTI
people led some to flee Uganda. The AHA
restricted the ability of LGBTI people to
access health care, especially HIV/AIDS and
sexual health care. In one positive move, the
Ministry of Health issued a directive in June
reaffirming the government’s commitment to
provide health services without discrimination,
including on the basis of sexual orientation.
In October, the Chief Magistrates Court at
Buganda Road, Kampala, dismissed charges
against Mukisa Kim, a gay man, and Mukasa
Jackson, a transgender woman, after the
prosecution repeatedly failed to confirm they
were ready to proceed with the trial. Mukisa
Kim had been charged under the Penal Code
with “having carnal knowledge of a person
against the order of nature”, while Mukasa
Jackson had been charged with “permitting a
male person to have carnal knowledge against
the order of nature”.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS
President Museveni signed the Anti-
Pornography Act (APA) into law on 6
February. Immediately after the signing,
women whom the public deemed to be
dressed indecently were attacked, stripped
and beaten by mobs in the streets. The
police confirmed four incidents in Kampala
city centre but failed to record them or
the victims’ particulars in the official crime
records, or to arrest the perpetrators of
the attacks.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
Police officers also used the APA to
harass women.
In February, Patience Akumu, a journalist
and women’s rights activist, was briefly
refused entry into Naguru police station
because of the way she was dressed.
In February, Lilian Drabo, a lawyer based
in Kampala, was threatened with arrest
because of her clothing at the Nakawa Court
in Kampala. The management of the Nakawa
High Court Central Circuit had put up a notice
warning that it would not tolerate indecent
apparel on court premises.
A petition filed in May challenging the
constitutionality of the APA remained
pending. The then Prime Minister’s
commitment in February to review the APA
had not been implemented by the end of
the year.
RIGHT TO HEALTH – ACCESS TO HIV/
AIDS HEALTH CARE SERVICES
In July, President Museveni signed into law
the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act.
The Act criminalized HIV transmission and
exposure and provided for mandatory HIV
testing. The Act allowed unjustified breaches
of the right to confidentiality. Local and
international NGOs raised concerns that
women in particular would be impacted
adversely and disproportionately by the
implementation of the Act.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Civil society organizations and activists
working on human rights, oil governance,
corruption and land issues continued to
face threats to their work. NGO offices and
staff came under surveillance while several
organizations reported receiving threats.
The offices of a number of organizations
including ActionAid Uganda, Foundation
for Human Rights Initiative, Human Rights
Network-Uganda (HURINET-U) and the
Anti-corruption Coalition of Uganda were
broken into by unidentified individuals.
The break-ins appeared to be attempts to
access information on the organizations’
381human rights and governance work. Police
investigations into most of these break-ins
remained pending.
On the night of 5 May, the offices of
HURINET-U were broken into. A server,
29 computers, office cameras, safes, and
security cameras were stolen.
On the night of 17 May, the offices of
the Uganda Land Alliance were broken
into. Documents, computers and cameras
were stolen.
A petition challenging the constitutionality
of the Non-Governmental Organizations
Registration (Amendment) Act filed in 2006
remained pending. Proposals made in 2013
to further amend the NGO Law ostensibly to
expand government control over NGO funding
and activities remained pending before the
Cabinet. Authorities also proposed a Civic
Education Policy which if adopted would
mean that any programmes to provide civic
education – including on human rights –
would need accreditation at the district level.
Organizations deemed in breach of the policy
could have their activities suspended for up to
six months, have their accreditation revoked,
or even blacklisted.
POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES
In July, groups of armed men staged violent
attacks mainly on police posts in Bundibugyo,
Kasese and Ntoroko. At least 65 people were
killed in the attacks, including civilians, some
of the attackers, and members of the police
force and the army. Following the outbreak
of conflict in South Sudan, Ugandan troops
were deployed to Juba city in December 2013
in response to a request by the South Sudan
government to help secure the capital. In
January, Ugandan troops were present in Bor,
Jonglei state, where they supported the South
Sudan authorities to regain control of the
city from opposition forces. Ugandan troops
remained in South Sudan throughout 2014.
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
International Criminal Court arrest warrants
issued in 2005 remained in force for Joseph
382
Kony, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)
leader, and three LRA commanders. The men
were still at large at the end of the year.
Former LRA commander Thomas Kwoyelo,
who in 2011 pleaded not guilty before the
International Crimes Division of the High
Court to charges of murder, wilful killing and
other offences committed in the context of
the conflict in northern Uganda, remained
remanded in prison. The government appeal
against the Constitutional Court’s decision
that Thomas Kwoyelo was entitled to amnesty
under the Amnesty Act of 2000 remained
pending before the Supreme Court. A
complaint submitted by Thomas Kwoyelo
to the African Commission on Human and
Peoples’ Rights challenging his continued
detention by the Ugandan government
remained pending.
UKRAINE
Ukraine
Head of state: Petro Poroshenko (replaced
Oleksandr Turchynov in June, who replaced Viktor
Yanukovych in February)
Head of government: Arseniy Yatsenyuk (replaced
Mykola Azarov in February)
Violence resulting from the protests in the
capital Kyiv and later in eastern Ukraine
escalated into a civil conflict with Russian
involvement. Violations by police, including
torture and other ill-treatment as well as
abusive use of force during demonstrations,
continued with near-total impunity for the
perpetrators, while investigations into such
incidents remained ineffective. Abductions
of individuals were carried out, particularly
by pro-Russian paramilitaries in the
occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea
and by both warring sides in eastern Ukraine
affected by conflict. Both sides violated the
laws of war. In Crimea, Russian restrictions
Amnesty International Report 2014/15on the rights to freedom of expression,
assembly and association were fully applied,
and pro-Ukrainian activists and members of
the Crimean Tatar community were targeted
by paramilitaries and persecuted by the de
facto authorities.
BACKGROUND
Pro-European demonstrations in Kyiv
(“EuroMaydan”) sparked in 2013 by the
government’s decision not to sign an
Association Agreement with the EU, resulted
in the ousting of President Yanukovych
on 22 February. Following the violent
dispersal by police of the initially peaceful
demonstration on the night of 29 November
2013, the demonstrators became increasingly
radicalized. Protesters erected tents on the
central Independence Square and occupied
several buildings. While most protesters
remained peaceful, violence by both sides
escalated. At least 85 demonstrators and
18 police officers died as a direct result
of violence at EuroMaydan in Kyiv, and
hundreds were injured.
After Viktor Yanukovych secretly left
Ukraine and an interim government was
formed, increasingly violent protests began in
the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass
region in eastern Ukraine. In Crimea,
buildings belonging to the local authorities
were occupied by armed paramilitaries calling
themselves “self-defence forces” on the night
of 26 to 27 February. Jointly with members of
regular Russian forces they blocked Ukrainian
military installations across the peninsula, and
on 27 February, in the presence of armed
men, the Crimean parliament elected a new
leadership. A “referendum” was called on 16
March on the status of Crimea. Participants
overwhelmingly voted in favour of unification
with Russia while opponents boycotted it. On
18 March, the de facto authorities of Crimea
signed a “treaty” in Moscow resulting in its
annexation by Russia.
By April, armed opponents of the new
government in Kyiv had occupied government
buildings, including police and security
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
headquarters, in the cities of Donetsk and
Luhansk and several smaller towns, effectively
taking control over large parts of Donbass.
On 15 April, the government announced the
beginning of an “anti-terrorist operation”.
The situation rapidly escalated into an
armed conflict between government forces
and separatist armed groups supported by
Russia. Pro-Kyiv forces were making steady
advances until late August when Russia
stepped up its covert military involvement in
Ukraine. 1 A ceasefire between the warring
sides was agreed at negotiations in Belarus in
September, although fighting continued on a
reduced scale, resulting in the deaths of more
than 4,000 people by the end of the year.
After the de facto authorities in Donetsk and
Luhansk held “elections” on 2 November,
Kyiv withdrew its offer of limited devolution for
the region.
Early presidential and parliamentary
elections were held on 25 May and 26
October respectively, returning pro-European
parties and politicians to power. On 16
September the European Parliament and the
Ukrainian parliament ratified the Association
Agreement with the EU, but it had not been
agreed by all EU member states by the end
of the year.
IMPUNITY – EUROMAYDAN
The three months of EuroMaydan
demonstrations shone a spotlight on the
systemic problem of impunity for the abusive
use of force, and for torture and other ill-
treatment of individuals by law enforcement
officers in Ukraine. Riot police first used
force against entirely peaceful protesters on
30 November 2013, when they refused to
disperse, resulting in dozens of injuries and
the brief detention of 35 peaceful protesters
on charges of hooliganism. In response to
widespread condemnation, the authorities
dismissed a senior Kyiv police official and
reportedly initiated criminal proceedings
against him and four others, but these were
never brought to any conclusion. In the
subsequent weeks and months, the police
383repeatedly resorted to the abusive use of
force at EuroMaydan as well as making
arbitrary arrests and attempting to initiate
arbitrary criminal proceedings against
demonstrators. 2 Eventually, firearms with
live ammunition, including sniper rifles, were
deployed at the demonstrations, although
it remained unclear which forces had used
them and under whose orders they had
acted. The head of the Ukrainian Security
Services (SBU) stated in November that 16
former riot police officers and five senior SBU
officials had been arrested in connection with
the killings of protesters in Kyiv.
After the downfall of Viktor Yanukovych,
the new authorities publicly committed to
effectively investigating and prosecuting those
responsible for deaths during EuroMaydan
and all the abuses against protesters.
However, apart from indicting former senior
political leadership, few if any concrete steps
were taken in this direction.
Only two law enforcement officers stood
trial for torture and other ill-treatment during
EuroMaydan, both low-ranking conscripts
from the Interior Ministry Troops. On 28
May, they were given suspended sentences
of three and two years respectively for
“exceeding authority or official powers”
(Article 365 of the Criminal Code) for their
ill-treatment of Mykhaylo Havryliuk on 22
January 2014. Video footage shows Mykhaylo
Havryliuk being forced to stand naked in
sub-zero temperatures in front of dozens of
officers from both Interior Ministry Troops
and riot police; many can be seen actively
humiliating him by forcing him to pose for
photographs before he is pushed into a bus.
Victims in 20 cases of abusive of use of
force by police in EuroMaydan monitored by
Amnesty International were frustrated by the
slow speed or apparent lack of investigation
into their allegations, the failure of the
authorities to identify the perpetrators and
poor communication from the Prosecutor’s
Office. 3
An International Advisory Panel on Ukraine
was established by the Council of Europe
384
in April to review EuroMaydan-related
investigations. It had not reported on the
progress of the investigations by the end of
the year.
ABDUCTIONS, DISAPPEARANCES
AND KILLINGS
During the protests in Kyiv, several dozen
EuroMaydan activists went missing. While the
fate of over 20 remained unclarified at the
end of the year, it transpired that some were
abducted and ill-treated. In December, the
Prosecutor General’s Office reported that 11
men suspected of abducting EuroMaydan
activists had been arrested and several others
placed on a wanted list. None were law
enforcement officials, although they allegedly
acted under orders from former senior
police officials.
Yury Verbytsky and Igor Lutsenko went
missing on 21 January, from hospital. Igor
Lutsenko reported that he was blindfolded
and beaten by his captors, and then dumped
in a forest in freezing temperatures. Yury
Verbytsky was found dead in a forest, his
ribs broken, with traces of duct tape around
his head.
Abductions and ill-treatment of captives
were common in Russian-occupied Crimea
and the parts of eastern Ukraine controlled
by separatists, affecting several hundred
people. Among the first people targeted
were members of local administrations,
pro-Ukrainian political activists, journalists
and international observers. In a press
conference on 23 April, the then self-
proclaimed “people’s mayor” of Slovyansk,
Vyacheslav Ponomarev, acknowledged that
separatists were holding a number of people
as “bargaining chips”. Subsequently, several
hundred captives were exchanged between
the separatists and the Ukrainian authorities.
Others were held for private ransom. Sasha,
a 19-year-old pro-Kyiv activist, was abducted
by members of an armed group in Luhansk
on 12 June. Beaten continuously for 24 hours
and tortured with electric shocks, he was
Amnesty International Report 2014/15released after his father reportedly paid a
US$60,000 ransom.
Allegations of abductions were repeatedly
made against members of pro-Kyiv forces,
particularly so-called volunteer battalions
deployed to fight alongside regular forces
in Donbass. Several cases of abuses by
Aidar battalion were documented between
June and August in Luhansk Region. These
included abductions of local men accused of
collaborating with the separatists and holding
them in makeshift detention facilities before
either releasing them or handing them over
to security services. In nearly all cases the
captives were subjected to beatings, and had
possessions, including cars and valuables,
seized by the battalion members or had to
pay a ransom for their release. 4
MP Oleh Lyashko published several videos
online of him leading a group of armed men
in balaclavas apprehending, interrogating
and ill-treating individuals he suspected of
collaborating with separatists. No criminal
investigation was initiated into his actions.
He won a seat again at the parliamentary
elections in October and his party entered the
ruling coalition.
There was evidence of summary killings by
each side in the conflict. Several separatist
commanders boasted of having put captives
to death for alleged crimes, and the de facto
separatist authorities introduced the “death
penalty” in their “criminal code”. 5
COMMUNAL VIOLENCE
With tensions affecting many regions of
the country, demonstrators for and against
the post-Yanukovych authorities clashed
repeatedly in several cities, with police often
failing to interfere or deal effectively with the
resulting violence.
In Odessa, on 2 May, 48 anti-EuroMaydan
protesters were killed, and over 200 injured,
inside a burning building besieged by their
opponents during violent clashes. Police
failed to take effective action to prevent
or contain the violence. Several criminal
investigations into these events were opened.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In November, the first court hearings began
in one of the related cases against 21 men,
all of them pro-Russian activists, under
charges relating to mass disorder and
unlawful use of firearms and explosives. The
secrecy surrounding the official investigations
prompted concern about their effectiveness
and impartiality.
ARMED CONFLICT
Over 4,000 people had died in the conflict
in eastern Ukraine by the end of the year.
Many civilian deaths resulted from the
indiscriminate use of force by both sides,
notably as a result of the use of unguided
mortars and rockets in civilian areas.
Both sides failed to take reasonable
precautions to protect civilians, in violation of
the laws of war. 6 Both placed troops, weaponry
and other military targets in residential
areas. On numerous occasions, separatist
forces used residential areas and buildings
as firing positions, while pro-Kyiv forces
returned fire to these positions. There was
little indication that either side was seriously
investigating alleged violations of international
humanitarian law and possible war crimes by
its own forces.
On 17 July, separatist forces reported the
destruction of a Ukrainian military plane.
When it transpired that a Malaysian Airlines
civilian passenger jet had been shot down,
killing nearly 300 people, the claim was
retracted, with both sides since blaming the
other for the act. An international investigation
into the incident was ongoing by the end of
the year.
DISPLACED PEOPLE
Those escaping the Russian occupation of
Crimea – around 20,000 – received some
state support for resettlement. Close to
a million people were estimated to have
been displaced as a result of the conflict in
Donbass, around half of them internally and
the rest mainly in Russia. In Ukraine, most
received limited state support and relied on
their own means, family networks and the
385assistance of volunteer organizations. The
adoption of a law on internally displaced
people, in October, had changed little on the
ground by the end of the year.
CRIMEA
Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea
in March, its restrictive laws were used to
suppress the rights to freedom of assembly,
association and expression in the territory.
Civil society organizations were effectively
closed down for non-compliance with Russian
legal requirements. Local residents were
declared Russian citizens. Those wishing to
retain Ukrainian citizenship were required to
notify the authorities.
The self-styled “self-defence” paramilitary
forces committed numerous grave abuses,
including enforced disappearances, with
impunity. De facto Prime Minister of Crimea,
Sergei Aksionov, stated that although these
paramilitaries had no official status or
authority, his government relied on them
and chose “sometimes to overlook” abuses
committed by them.
There were numerous reports of
abductions of pro-Ukrainian activists
in Crimea.
EuroMaydan activists Oleksandra
Ryazantseva and Kateryna Butko were
abducted on 9 March after being stopped
at a checkpoint, reportedly manned by riot
police officers and Crimean “self-defence”
paramilitaries armed with guns and knives.
They were released on 12 March. 7
Oleg Sentsov, a well known pro-Ukrainian
activist and film director, was secretly arrested
by Russian security officials in Crimea
on 9 May and unlawfully transferred to
Moscow, along with several other individuals.
Criminal proceedings against him – under
terrorism-related charges that appeared
groundless – were conducted in secrecy, and
his allegations of torture dismissed by the
authorities.
Crimean Tatars, an ethnic group indigenous
to the peninsula (deported to remote parts of
the Soviet Union in 1944 and not allowed to
386
return until the late 1980s), were particularly
targeted by the de facto authorities for the
public expression of pro-Ukrainian views.
Starting in March, there were a number of
abductions and beatings of Crimean Tatars
which the de facto authorities failed to
investigate.
On 3 March Reshat Ametov, a Crimean
Tatar, was led away by three men from the
“self-defence” forces after staging a one-
man protest in front of the Crimean Council
of Ministers building in the region’s capital
Simferopol. His body was found almost two
weeks later, showing signs of torture. His
abductors were not identified.
The de facto authorities started a campaign
to close the Mejlis, a body elected by the
Crimean Tatar assembly (Kurultai) and
recognized by the Ukrainian authorities as the
representative organ of the Tatar community.
Mustafa Dzhemiliev, a veteran human
rights defender and founder of the Mejlis,
was banned from entering Crimea. He was
repeatedly denied entry, including on 3 May
when he tried to cross through a checkpoint
at Armyansk. Hundreds of Crimean Tatars
came to meet him. The de facto authorities
claimed that this was an unlawful assembly,
and dozens of participants were fined. The
homes of several Crimean Tatar leaders were
subsequently searched and at least four
Crimean Tatars were arrested, charged with
“extremism” and transferred to Russia for
investigation.
On 5 July, Refat Chubarov, who succeeded
Mustafa Dzhemiliev as the leader of the
Mejlis, was also prevented from returning to
Crimea and banned for five years. The newly
appointed de facto Prosecutor of Crimea
travelled to the border crossing to warn him
that the activities of the Mejlis violated the
Russian law on extremism. On 19 September,
the Russian authorities confiscated the
headquarters of the Mejlis on the grounds
that its founder (Mustafa Dzhemiliev) was a
foreign citizen, who had been banned from
entering Russia.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15On 16 May, just two days before the
planned annual events to mark the 70th
anniversary of the deportation of Crimean
Tatars in 1944, the de facto Prime Minister
of Crimea announced that all mass meetings
in Crimea would be banned until 6 June,
in order to “eliminate possible provocations
by extremists” and to prevent “disruption
of the summer holiday season”. Just one
commemorative Crimean Tatar event was
allowed on the day, on the outskirts of
Simferopol, with a heavy police presence.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
An LGBTI Pride March planned for 5 July in
Kyiv was cancelled after the police told the
organizing committee that they could not
secure the safety of participants in the face of
expected counter-demonstrations. The newly
elected Mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klychko, stated
on 27 June that this was not the time for such
“entertainment events” in Ukraine.

FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
The authorities used provisions of the Penal
Code and the cybercrimes law of 2012 to
stifle dissent and to prosecute and imprison
government critics on charges including
“instigating hatred against the state”, and
“contacting foreign organizations”, based on
comments they had posted on social media.
Those imprisoned included Osama al-Najjar,
who was prosecuted on charges arising
from his use of Twitter to campaign for the
387release of his father, Hussain Ali al-Najjar
al-Hammadi.
Hussain Ali al-Najjar al-Hammadi and 60
others associated with al-Islah, the Reform
and Social Guidance Association, remained
in prison serving sentences of up to 10 years.
They were convicted on national security
charges in July 2013 after the unfair “UAE
94” trial before the State Security Chamber of
the Federal Supreme Court (FSC). The Court
failed to investigate allegations that some
defendants were tortured during months
of pre-trial incommunicado detention to
obtain “confessions” that formed the basis
of the prosecution case against them, and
which the court accepted as evidence. The
defendants were denied a right of appeal, in
breach of international fair trial standards.
They included prisoners of conscience
Mohammed al-Roken, a prominent human
rights lawyer, former judge Ahmed al-Zaabi,
and bloggers Saleh Mohammed al-Dhufairi
and Khalifa al-Nuaimi. The UN Working
Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that the
61 defendants imprisoned were victims of
arbitrary arrest and detention, and urged the
government to release them and afford them
appropriate reparation.
In February, after visiting the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), the UN Special Rapporteur
on the independence of judges and lawyers
urged the government to conduct an
independent investigation into allegations of
torture of detainees and institute a right of
appeal in cases heard in first instance by the
FSC, among other reforms.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
The authorities failed to conduct independent
investigations into allegations of torture and
other ill-treatment made by defendants in
trials before the State Security Chamber of
the FSC in 2013 and 2014 and by several
British nationals detained by police on
suspicion of drugs offences. Reported
methods of torture and other ill-treatment
included beating, electric shocks, exposure to
extreme temperatures and continuous bright
388
lights, sleep deprivation, and threats of rape
and death.
In September, UAE authorities forcibly
returned an Ethiopian national, despite fears
that he would face torture in Ethiopia.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
The authorities detained scores of people,
including foreign nationals, as terrorism
suspects and held them in undisclosed
locations without access to their families or
legal counsel, often for long periods.
In January, the State Security Chamber
of the FSC imposed prison terms of up to
five years on 10 Emiratis and 20 Egyptians
after convicting them of secretly establishing
an “international branch” of the Muslim
Brotherhood in the UAE. The 10 Emiratis
were already serving lengthy prison terms
imposed at the end of the “UAE 94” trial
in July 2013. Their trial did not meet
international fair trial standards.
In March, the FSC convicted three men on
charges including “financially and morally”
supporting al-Islah, sentencing two Emiratis to
five-year prison terms and a Qatari national to
seven years’ imprisonment. The defendants
denied the charges but were convicted on the
basis of “confessions” that they said security
officials had obtained from them under torture
or other duress.
In June, the FSC convicted seven foreign
nationals on terrorism-related charges,
imposing sentences of between seven years’
and life imprisonment, and in September the
Court began trying 15 defendants accused of
involvement with armed groups participating
in the Syrian conflict. In December, 11 of the
defendants were convicted and sentenced to
between three years’ and life imprisonment;
the others were acquitted.
A new anti-terrorism law enacted in August
prescribed severe penalties, including death,
for people convicted of terrorism, defined
broadly to include any acts resulting in a
“terrorist outcome,” such as declaring by any
public means “enmity to the state or regime”
or “non-allegiance to its leadership”.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15In November, the government declared
al-Islah and more than 80 other groups
“terrorist” organizations; they included many
armed groups active in other countries as well
as several Muslim aid organizations.
and ascertain whether they would accept
“blood money” for their relatives’ deaths. In
May, press reports indicated that a court in
Abu Dhabi sentenced a woman to death by
stoning for adultery.
WOMEN’S RIGHTS
Women faced discrimination in law and
practice. The UN Special Rapporteur on the
independence of judges and lawyers recorded
“institutionalized gender discrimination within
the administration of justice”. She highlighted
that women were not allowed to become
federal court judges, in violation of CEDAW, to
which the UAE is a party.

MIGRANT WORKER’S RIGHTS
Despite protective provisions in the 1980
Labour Law and subsequent decrees, foreign
migrant workers were exploited and abused.
Many workers, who had generally paid fees
to recruiting agents, reported that they were
deceived over the terms and conditions of
their work. Construction workers often lived in
poor and inadequate accommodation, while
few held their own passports. Late payment
or non-payment of wages was common. The
kafala sponsorship system made workers
vulnerable to abuse by employers, while those
involved in collective action such as strikes or
sit-ins were liable to arrest and deportation.
Domestic workers, mostly women from
Asia, continued to be excluded from the
protections afforded to other migrant workers,
and faced physical violence, confinement
to places of work and labour abuses. The
authorities had been considering a draft law
on domestic workers since at least 2012 but
did not enact it in 2014.
DEATH PENALTY
Courts continued to impose death sentences,
mostly for murder. In January, the authorities
in Sharjah emirate executed a Sri Lankan
man by firing squad. The following month,
the President declared a stay on all
pending executions for murder to enable
the authorities to contact victims’ families
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
The Prime Minister confirmed that a
Conservative Party government would repeal
the Human Rights Act if elected in 2015.
Allegations of torture in relation to counter-
terrorism operations overseas remained
unresolved. The government passed
legislation extending communications
data interception powers. Accountability
mechanisms for historical human rights
violations and abuses in Northern
Ireland remained inadequate. Access to
abortion remained extremely limited in
Northern Ireland.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In a referendum held in Scotland
in September, voters opted against
independence.
Charities and civil society organizations
expressed concerns about the Transparency
of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and
Trade Union Administration Act 2014, which
entered into force in September. The Act
could significantly restrict their public-facing
campaigning in a “regulated period” leading
up to a national election.
The effects of cuts to legal aid made in
2012 and 2013, including under the Legal
Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act, continued to restrict access to justice.
389Legislation introduced to restrict judicial
review raised similar concerns.
In October, Prime Minister Cameron
confirmed that, if elected, a Conservative
Party government would repeal the Human
Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of
Rights, with a view to limiting the influence of
the European Court of Human Rights. Draft
proposals threatened significant restrictions
on rights.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Detainee Inquiry
In December 2013, a report of the Detainee
Inquiry’s preparatory work was published,
23 months after the Justice Secretary’s
closure of an inquiry into allegations of UK
involvement in torture and other violations
against individuals detained abroad in
counter-terrorism operations. The report set
out lines of investigation for any future inquiry.
The government announced that the matters
raised by the Detainee Inquiry’s report
would be addressed by the parliamentary
Intelligence and Security Committee, rather
than by an independent, public inquiry. 1 The
government deferred indefinitely the prospect
of any new, independent, judge-led inquiry.
Libyan renditions
On 30 October, the Court of Appeal ruled
that there were compelling reasons requiring
it to exercise jurisdiction over a civil claim
brought by married couple Abdul Hakim
Belhaj and Fatima Boudchar, who alleged
that they were victims of rendition, torture
and other ill-treatment in 2004 by the US and
Libyan governments, with the knowledge and
co-operation of UK officials. 2 The government
appealed against the decision.
Diplomatic assurances
The government continued to rely on
unreliable and unenforceable diplomatic
assurances when seeking to deport
individuals allegedly posing a threat to
national security to countries where they
would be at risk of grave human rights
violations, including torture.
390
In July 2013, the UK authorities deported
Abu Qatada to Jordan where the State
Security Court failed to disregard torture-
tainted “confessions” in two criminal trials
against him (see Jordan entry). In July 2014,
the Court of Appeal heard an appeal by
eight Algerian nationals against a January
2013 decision by the Special Immigration
Appeals Commission to allow their deportation
with assurances.
Armed forces in Iraq
In May 2013, the High Court ruled that the
Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), a
unit within the Ministry of Defence set up
to investigate allegations of abuses of Iraqi
civilians by UK armed forces between March
2003 and July 2009, was failing to meet its
obligations to uphold the right to life. The
judge ruled that small inquiries modelled
on inquests were needed, but rejected the
claimants’ arguments that IHAT lacked
independence and should be replaced by a
single, public inquiry.
In May 2014, the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court reopened a
preliminary investigation into allegations that
UK armed forces committed war crimes
involving systematic detainee abuse in Iraq.
In November, a High Court judge ruled that
two Pakistani men captured by UK forces in
Iraq in 2004 and subsequently transferred
to US custody in Afghanistan, had the right
to sue the UK government in UK courts
for damages.
In December, the Al-Sweady Inquiry,
established in 2009 to examine allegations
that British soldiers tortured or ill-treated nine
Iraqi detainees after a battle near the town
of Majar al-Kabir in southern Iraq in 2004,
published its findings. The report found
the most serious allegations to be “wholly
without foundation”, but acknowledged that
detainee handling practices had been “less
than satisfactory” and “developed on an ad
hoc basis”, and compounded by the lack of
guidance for soldiers.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
In October 2013, the Supreme Court stated its
concern about the excessively broad statutory
definition of terrorism in the case of R v.
Gul, referring to reports by the Independent
Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. In February
2014, however, the High Court held that the
decision to stop, question and detain David
Miranda, the spouse of journalist Glenn
Greenwald, in August 2013 under Schedule
7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 had been
lawful and proportionate. The decision was
appealed against. The Independent Reviewer
reiterated his call for narrowing the definitions
of “terrorism” and “terrorism-related activity”
during the year.
In October, the prosecution of UK national
Moazzam Begg collapsed. He was on trial for
seven terrorism-related offences relating to
Syria. The prosecution offered no evidence at
trial after receiving new information, allegedly
from the British security service MI5. The trial
judge formally entered “not guilty” judgments
on all seven charges. 3
In November, the government introduced
the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill as
fast-tracked legislation. The proposed powers
included restricting the travel of people
suspected of involvement in terrorism-related
activity, including exclusion of certain UK
residents who refuse to agree to government-
imposed conditions on their return home. It
also added powers under existing Terrorism
Prevention and Investigation Measures,
restricting the liberty, movement and activities
of people believed to pose a threat to
national security.
NORTHERN IRELAND
The mechanisms and institutions mandated
to address “legacy” (conflict-related or
historical) human rights violations in previous
decades operated in a fragmented and
incremental manner.
The Historical Enquiries Team (HET),
mandated since 2006 to re-examine all
deaths attributed to the conflict in Northern
Ireland, was closed following wide criticism.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In July 2013, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate
of Constabulary had found that the HET
reviewed cases involving the state with less
rigour than non-state cases. The transfer,
announced in December, of some of HET’s
work to a Legacy Investigative Branch within
the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)
prompted concerns over the independence of
future case reviews.
Positive reforms to the Office of the Police
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland (OPONI)
continued throughout 2013 and 2014. A
30 September report by Criminal Justice
Inspection Northern Ireland found that
confidence in the OPONI’s investigation of
historical cases had been “fully restored”.
However, on the same day, cuts to the
OPONI’s budget led to a loss of 25% of
staff working on legacy cases, and serious
concerns about the OPONI’s ability to
complete “legacy” casework.
Under-resourcing and delays to Northern
Ireland’s coronial inquest system remained
endemic. In a November judgment, the Lord
Chief Justice of Northern Ireland noted that
the legislative failure to remedy deficiencies in
the inquest system were preventing coroners
from exercising their role satisfactorily and
expeditiously.
The government remained unwilling
to establish public inquiries into legacy
cases. In September 2013, the Northern
Ireland Secretary refused to establish an
inquiry into the August 1998 bombing by
the Real IRA armed group in Omagh. The
government continued to refuse to establish
an independent inquiry into the 1989 killing
of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane. 4
In September 2013, inter-party talks
chaired by former US diplomat Richard
Haass began with the aim of reaching
agreement on parades and protests; the use
of flags, symbols and emblems; and how
to deal with “the past”. The talks ended
without agreement on 31 December 2013.
The draft Haass proposals detailed two
mechanisms: an Historical Investigation
Unit (HIU) and an Independent Commission
391for Information Retrieval (ICIR). 5 Further
talks, which concluded in December 2014,
agreed in principle to take forward the Haass
proposals of an HIU and ICIR, although
details of finance, resourcing, timeframes and
legislation were not completely resolved at the
end of the year.
In June, the Irish television channel RTÉ
broadcast newly discovered archival material
suggesting that the UK had misled the
European Court of Human Rights in Ireland
v. UK, over the use of five torture techniques
used by British security forces in Northern
Ireland in 1971-1972. In December, the
Irish government sought a reopening of the
case by the European Court. Lawyers for
the victims also called for an independent,
human rights-compliant investigation in the
UK into the new evidence. 6
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Access to abortion in Northern Ireland
remained limited to exceptional cases where
the life or health of the woman or girl was at
risk. The Abortion Act 1967 did not apply to
Northern Ireland. In October, the Department
of Justice opened a consultation on legislating
for access to abortion in cases of rape, incest
and fatal foetal anomaly.
SURVEILLANCE
In July, the Data Retention and Investigatory
Powers Act entered into force, extending
the reach of the authorities’ interception
powers by providing potentially wide-ranging
extraterritorial effects to UK interception
warrants. Sufficient safeguards were not in
place to ensure that such surveillance was
authorized and carried out in conformity
with the rights to privacy and freedom
of expression.
In December, the Investigatory Powers
Tribunal (IPT) made public its open judgment
in the first part of a complaint brought by
Amnesty International and other NGOs
about the UK authorities’ communications
surveillance practices. The IPT found that
the authorities’ surveillance practices were in
392
accordance with the law. Significant portions
of the proceedings were held in secret. 7
REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
In January, the government announced that it
would provide resettlement for 500 vulnerable
Syrian refugees. The Vulnerable Persons
Relocation scheme prioritizes assisting
survivors of torture and violence, women and
children at risk and those in need of medical
care, as identified by UNHCR, the UN
refugee agency.
In July 2013, an inquest jury returned a
verdict of unlawful killing in the death in 2010
of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan national
who died after being restrained by private
security guards on board a plane deporting
him to Angola. In December, the three guards
involved in his removal were cleared of
manslaughter.
In July, the High Court found that the
long-term immigration detention of a Guinean
woman constituted inhuman and degrading
treatment. It was the sixth such court finding
since 2011.
In December, the Court of Appeal found
the policy underpinning the UK’s “detained
fast-track” asylum process to be unlawful and
upheld the High Court’s earlier July ruling
that inadequate access to legal representation
rendered the process unlawful.
TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN BEINGS
In June, the government published draft
legislation to address slavery and human
trafficking in England and Wales. The Modern
Slavery Bill was amended to include UK-wide
provisions, including the establishment of an
anti-slavery commissioner.
Also in June, the anti-trafficking legislation
was presented to the Northern Ireland
Assembly. Similar legislation was presented to
the Scottish Parliament in December.

OF AMERICA
United States of America
Head of state and government: Barack Obama
President Obama acknowledged that
torture had been carried out following the
11 September 2001 attacks (9/11) under
a secret detention programme authorized
by his predecessor and operated by the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). However,
accountability and remedy for the crimes
under international law committed in
that programme remained absent. The
declassified summary of a Senate report into
the programme was released in December.

a handful of cases. Concern about the use
of prolonged isolation in state and federal
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
The USA appeared before three UN treaty
bodies in 2014. In April, the Human Rights
Committee criticized the USA on a range of
issues – including the lack of accountability
for abuses in the counter-terrorism context,
solitary confinement in prisons, racial
disparities in the criminal justice system,
targeted killings by drones, excessive use
of force by law enforcement officials, the
treatment of migrants and the death penalty. 1
In August, the Committee on the Elimination
of Racial Discrimination also made numerous
recommendations to the USA. In November,
the Committee against Torture’s concluding
observations similarly covered a range of
issues. 2
IMPUNITY
In August, President Obama acknowledged
that the USA used torture in its response
to the 9/11 attacks. He stated that torture
was carried out under “some” of the
“enhanced interrogation techniques” used
in the programme, not just the one known
as “waterboarding” (mock execution by
interrupted drowning). Nevertheless, the
President remained silent on accountability
and redress, reflecting the USA’s continuing
refusal to meet its international obligations
on these issues. Neither did he make any
reference to enforced disappearance, a crime
under international law to which most, if not
all, of those held in the secret programme
were subjected, some of them for years. 3
In April, the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence (SSCI) voted to submit
for declassification the summary of its
report into the CIA’s secret detention and
interrogation programme operated between
2002 and 2008. Release of the summary
came on 9 December and the 500-page
document contained some new details on
the programme and the torture and other
393human rights violations committed in it. The
full 6,700 page report – containing “details of
each detainee in CIA custody, the conditions
under which they were detained, [and] how
they were interrogated” – remained classified
top secret.
COUNTER-TERROR – DETENTIONS
At the end of 2014, 127 men were held at
Guantánamo, the majority without charge
or trial. Almost half had been approved for
transfer out of the base, most since January
2010 or earlier. Twenty-eight detainees were
transferred out of the base during the year,
following the 11 who had been transferred
from there in 2013.
The transfer to Qatar in May of five Afghan
men held in Guantánamo for more than a
decade, in exchange for a US soldier held
for five years in Taliban custody, sparked
congressional opposition to President
Obama’s stated goal of closing the detention
facility. 4
Some detainees engaged in hunger strikes
during the year, although not in the numbers
seen during 2013. 5 Official transparency
around hunger strikes remained at issue
following the policy decision in late 2013 to
stop making public the number of detainees
engaging in such protests. In litigation in
May 2014, the government disclosed that it
possessed videotapes, classified as secret,
of the forcible cell extractions and forced
feeding of Abu Wa’el Dhiab, a Syrian man
held at the base but approved for transfer
since 2009. In October, over government
opposition, a District Court judge ordered
the videotape evidence to be unsealed and
certain information redacted from the tapes.
The administration appealed, and the case
was pending in the US Court of Appeals at
the end of the year.
In November, the US administration told
the UN Committee against Torture that, in
contrast to positions previously taken by the
US government, the USA had now decided
that the Convention against Torture applied
394
at Guantánamo and on US-registered ships
and aircraft.
In February, Ahmed Mohammed al Darbi,
a Saudi Arabian national arrested by civilian
authorities in Azerbaijan in June 2002 and
transferred to US custody two months later,
pleaded guilty at a hearing before a military
commission judge at Guantánamo and
agreed not to sue the USA over his treatment
in custody. His conviction brought to eight
the number of detainees convicted by military
commission since detentions began at
Guantánamo in January 2002. Six of these
eight men were convicted under pre-trial
plea bargains.
Pre-trial military commission proceedings
continued against five Guantánamo detainees
– Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid bin
Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, ‘Ali ‘Abd al-‘Aziz
and Mustafa al Hawsawi – accused of
involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The five and
‘Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was arraigned
for capital trial in 2011 on charges relating
to the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen
in 2000, had been held incommunicado in
secret US custody for up to four years prior to
their transfer to Guantánamo in 2006. Their
trials had not begun by the end of 2014.
Iraqi national ‘Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, who was
reportedly arrested in Turkey in October 2006,
transferred to US custody, held in secret by
the CIA and transferred to Guantánamo in
April 2007, was arraigned in June. His trial on
charges under the Military Commissions Act
(MCA) was pending at the end of 2014.
In May, the General Counsel for the US
Department of Defense affirmed that the
administration was continuing to use the
2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF) as the underpinning of its detention
operations in Afghanistan and Guantánamo
and “capture or lethal operations” against
individuals elsewhere. He pointed to the
case of Libyan national Nazih Abdul-Hamed
al-Ruqai, also known as Abu Anas al-Libi, as
an example of an operation that relied on the
AUMF. Abu al-Libi was abducted in Tripoli,
Libya, by US forces on 5 October 2013 and
Amnesty International Report 2014/15interrogated aboard the USS San Antonio
before being taken to the USA and charged
in relation to the 1998 bombings of two US
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Abu al-Libi’s lawyer alleged in court in
2014 that the abduction had been conducted
“with the use of extreme physical and brutal
force”, and that after dragging the suspect
from his car and “using tazer-like weapons”
on him, the US forces had blindfolded him,
and “bound, gagged and trussed [him] up”.
On the ship, he was held incommunicado and
interrogated daily for the next week by CIA
personnel and others. He alleged that he was
subjected, effectively, to sleep deprivation,
through the use of prolonged back-to-back
interrogations. His incommunicado detention
and interrogation were cut short due to a
life-threatening illness. His trial was pending
at the end of the year, but on 31 December,
he was taken to hospital where he died on 2
January 2015.
US forces seized Ahmed Abu Khatallah
near Benghazi, eastern Libya, on 15 June.
On 17 June, the US administration informed
the UN Security Council that the US operation
to take Ahmed Khatallah into custody had
been conducted under the USA’s “inherent
right to self-defense” on the grounds that
he “continued to plan further armed attacks
against US persons”. The letter gave no
information about this alleged planning,
rendering an assessment of the USA’s self-
defence claim all but impossible. In October,
Ahmed Khatallah was charged with offences
punishable by the death penalty in relation
to an attack on the US diplomatic mission in
Benghazi in 2012 in which four US nationals
were killed. He was being held in pre-trial
solitary confinement in Virginia at the end of
the year. 6
During the year, the remaining non-
Afghan detainees in US military detention
at the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan
were transferred to the custody of other
governments. In August, two Yemeni nationals
held in US custody in Afghanistan for more
than a decade were transferred to Yemen.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
In November, a Russian national who had
been held in US military custody at Bagram
since 2009 was transferred to the USA for
prosecution in a federal court on terrorism
charges. Ireq Ilgiz Hamidullin became the
first detainee to be transferred from Bagram
directly to the USA, almost 13 years after
detentions began at the base.
Tunisian national Redha al Najar was
transferred to Afghan custody on 10
December, the day after release of the SSCI
summary report in which his case featured
as one of those subjected to torture in a
secret CIA facility in Afghanistan in 2002. On
11 December, the Department of Defense
said that the Bagram detention facility was
now closed.
In November, President Obama said that
discussions between Congress and the
administration were continuing on how to
“right-size and update” the AUMF “to suit the
current fight, rather than previous fights”.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Tens of thousands of prisoners remained in
isolation in state and federal prisons across
the USA, confined to cells for between 22 and
24 hours a day in conditions of stark social
and environmental deprivation.
In February, the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee held a second hearing on
solitary confinement. Senator Durbin who
chaired the hearing and urged reform of this
practice, also pushed during the year for the
opening of a new federal prison which would
extend the number of federal isolation cells.
Amnesty International’s report into federal use
of isolation concluded that conditions in the
only current super-maximum security prison
in Florence, Colorado, breached standards for
the humane treatment of prisoners. 7
In October, a settlement was reached
in a class-action suit on behalf of more
than 33,000 prisoners in Arizona’s state
prisons. Under this settlement, the Arizona
Department of Corrections will allow prisoners
in solitary confinement who have serious
395mental illnesses to have more mental health
treatment and time outside their cells.
DEATH PENALTY
Thirty-three men and two women were put to
death in 2014. Including the execution of 38
men and one woman in 2013, this brought
to 1,394 the total number of people executed
since the US Supreme Court approved new
capital laws in 1976.
The number of executions in 2014 was the
lowest since 1994. The continuing problems
faced by states in obtaining drugs for lethal
injections, and concerns over a number of
“botched” executions, contributed to the
slowdown. The 79 death sentences passed in
2013 and a similar number passed in 2014
represented a decline of about two thirds
since the mid-1990s. A little under 3,000
men and about 55 women remained on death
row at the end of the year.
Momentum against the death penalty
continued with the announcement in
February by the Governor of Washington
State that he would not allow executions
there while he held that office. This followed
Maryland’s abolition of the death penalty
in 2013, bringing to 18 the number of
abolitionist states, and strong indications that
no executions would occur in Colorado under
its current governor.
Executions in 2014 were carried out in
seven states, two lower than in 2013. Just
four states – Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas – accounted for 89% of the
national judicial death toll in 2014. By the
end of 2014, Texas accounted for 37% of all
executions carried out in the USA since 1976.
Texas has executed more people for crimes
committed when they were 17, 18 or 19
years old than any other state has executed
in total. 8
On 27 May, the US Supreme Court clarified
the protection for capital defendants with
intellectual disability (formerly known in the
USA as “mental retardation”). The Court
ruled that Florida’s law requiring a capital
defendant to show an IQ score of 70 or
396
below was unconstitutional as it blocked
the presentation of evidence other than IQ
that would demonstrate limitations in the
defendant’s mental faculties. 9
Lawyers for Ramiro Hernandez Llanas,
a Mexican national on death row in Texas,
had sought a stay of execution until after the
Supreme Court ruling to allow its impact on
his case to be assessed. No stay was granted
and he was executed on 9 April, despite a
compelling claim that his intellectual disability
rendered his execution unconstitutional. In
January, Texas executed another Mexican
national in violation of an order of the
International Court of Justice and despite a
finding by the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights that he had been denied a fair
trial. Edgar Arias Tamayo had been denied
his right to seek consular assistance after
his arrest.
In January, Florida executed Askari
Abdullah Muhammad (formerly Thomas
Knight), who had been on death row for four
decades and had a long history of serious
mental illness. In September, Earl Ringo,
an African American man, was executed in
Missouri despite claims that race had tainted
the prosecution; he was sentenced to death
by an all-white jury at a trial in which the
defence lawyer, the judge and the prosecutor
were also white. 10
During the year, seven previously
condemned inmates were released on the
grounds of innocence, bringing to 150 the
number of such cases in the USA since 1973.
CHILDREN’S RIGHTS – LIFE
IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT PAROLE
Defendants who were under 18 years old
at the time of the crime continued to face
life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole (life without parole). States responded
in various ways to the 2012 US Supreme
Court decision, Miller v. Alabama, outlawing
mandatory life without parole for this age
group. By October 2014, eight state supreme
courts had ruled that the Miller ruling was
retroactive, compared to four that had
Amnesty International Report 2014/15ruled to the contrary. In December, the US
Supreme Court agreed to review the appeal
of a prisoner sentenced under Louisiana’s
mandatory sentencing scheme to life without
parole for a crime committed when he was
17, to decide the Miller retroactivity question.
The case was pending at the end of the year.
In August, the American Correctional
Association adopted a resolution opposing life
without parole against those who were under
18 at the time of the crime and supporting
“sentencing policies that hold youthful
offenders accountable in an age-appropriate
way, while focusing on rehabilitation and
reintegration into society”.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
At least 35 people across 18 states died after
being struck by police Tasers, bringing the
total number of such deaths since 2001 to
602. Tasers have been listed as a cause or
contributory factor in more than 60 deaths.
Most of those who died after being struck with
a Taser were not armed and did not appear
to pose a serious threat when the Taser
was deployed.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed
African American man, was fatally shot by
police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson,
Missouri on 9 August. The shooting set off
months of protests in and around Ferguson.
The use of heavy-duty riot gear and military-
grade weapons and equipment to police the
demonstrations served to intimidate protesters
who were exercising their right to peaceful
assembly while the use of rubber bullets, tear
gas and other aggressive dispersal tactics was
not warranted, and protesters and journalists
were injured as a result.
A number of other incidents demonstrated
the need for a review of standards on the
use of force in the USA. These included the
deaths of Kajieme Powell, a 25-year-old black
man, who was shot and killed by St Louis
City Police on 19 August, with film footage
of the incident appearing to contradict the
initial official version of events; Ezell Ford,
25, an unarmed black man with a history of
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
mental illness, who was shot and killed by
Los Angeles police officers on 11 August;
and Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man,
who died on 17 July after being placed in a
chokehold by New York Police Department
officers while being arrested for selling loose,
untaxed cigarettes. After a grand jury declined
to return an indictment in the Garner case
on 3 December, the US Attorney General
announced a federal civil rights investigation
into his death.
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS –
UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN
More than 50,000 unaccompanied migrant
children were apprehended crossing the
southern border of the USA in 2014, some
as young as five. The US Border Patrol
detained unaccompanied children for days
or weeks in insanitary facilities and without
access to legal counsel, translators or proper
medical attention.

URUGUAY
Eastern Republic of Uruguay
Head of state and government: José Alberto Mujica
Cordano
The fight for justice for human rights
violations committed during the period of
civil and military rule between 1973 and
1985 faced a possible step back following
a Supreme Court decision in 2013. There
were concerns over barriers to women’s
access to abortions.
BACKGROUND
Uruguay was reviewed under the UN
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process
in January and accepted important
recommendations, including to combat all
forms of discrimination.
Uruguay ratified the UN Arms Trade Treaty
in September.
Six detainees from the US detention centre
in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, were resettled in
Uruguay in December.
General elections took place in October.
Frente Amplio won following the second
round in November.
IMPUNITY
In February 2013 the Supreme Court
overturned two key articles of Law 18.831,
adopted in 2011, which established that
crimes committed during the period of civil
and military rule between 1973 and 1985
398
were crimes against humanity and that no
statute of limitations could be applied. The
Supreme Court also concluded that no crimes
against humanity were committed at the time
because they were made criminal under
national law only in 2006, and therefore
they were subject to a statute of limitations. 1
During 2014 little progress was made to
ensure that complaints for past human rights
violations would be fully investigated.
The trial of a former police officer, charged
in 2012 with complicity in the killing of
teacher and journalist Julio Castro in 1977,
continued at the end of the year.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
Compulsory requirements established by the
2012 law decriminalizing abortion remained
a concern as they were a potential obstacle
to accessing legal abortion. The 2012 law
established a mandatory five-day reflection
period and a review of cases by a panel
of experts when an abortion is requested.
Where pregnancy is a result of a rape, the law
required that a judicial complaint be filed for
the woman to access an abortion.
In April, in Salto, capital of Salto
department, doctors refused to provide an
abortion to a disabled pregnant girl who was
a rape survivor, on grounds of conscientious
objection. The girl had to travel to the capital
Montevideo for the procedure.
PRISON CONDITIONS
In May, the UN Committee against Torture
expressed concerns that two thirds of the
prison population was awaiting trial, as well
as concerns in relation to medical care, water
supply, sanitation and ventilation in cells.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Investigations into the killings of five
transsexual women between 2011 and 2012
showed little progress. In only one case, in
the Department of Cerro Largo, three people
were prosecuted.

UZBEKISTAN
Republic of Uzbekistan
Head of state: Islam Karimov
Head of government: Shavkat Mirzioiev
Torture and other ill-treatment in detention
facilities remained routine and pervasive.
The authorities continued to reject
allegations of torture committed by law
enforcement and National Security officers
and failed to effectively investigate credible
and persistent reports of such human rights
violations. Prison sentences of individuals
convicted of anti-state and terrorism
offences were arbitrarily extended and many
were denied necessary medical attention.
Those forcibly returned from abroad were at
real risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
TORTURE AND OTHER ILL-TREATMENT
Persistent and credible allegations continued
to emerge of pervasive and routine torture
and other ill-treatment by law enforcement
and National Security (SNB) officers during
arrest, transfer, in police custody and in pre-
trial detention and by law enforcement and
prison personnel in post-conviction detention
facilities. 1
The authorities continued to vigorously
deny such reports, including during public
examinations of Uzbekistan’s human
rights record at the EU-Uzbekistan Human
Rights Dialogue in November. They instead
pointed at the implementation of wide-
ranging initiatives in the field of human
rights education, such as numerous
torture prevention training programmes
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
for law enforcement officers and judicial
and medical officials, and increased
co-operation on human rights with the
international community. However, as in
previous years, these developments failed
to lead to necessary, genuine and wide-
reaching systemic reforms. Serious concerns
remained about the authorities’ failure to
implement existing laws and safeguards and
to adopt new effective measures towards
the prevention of torture. The authorities
also failed to effectively investigate reports of
torture and other ill-treatment.
In November, the UN Human Rights
Committee requested that Uzbekistan
report on measures taken to implement
the Committee’s numerous previous
recommendations to address torture from
1999, 2005 and 2010.
PRISON CONDITIONS
Certain categories of prisoners, such as
human rights defenders, government critics
and individuals convicted of membership
in Islamist parties and groups or Islamic
movements banned in Uzbekistan were
often subjected to severe punishment
regimes in prisons where they were serving
their sentences. Some prisoners had their
sentences extended for long periods –
sometimes repeatedly – even for alleged
minor infractions of the prison rules.
Murad Dzhuraev, a former parliamentarian
who was sentenced to 12 years in prison
on politically motivated charges in 1995,
subsequently had his sentence extended four
times under Article 221 of the Criminal Code
for allegedly breaking prison rules. 2 One of
the “violations” he had committed was failing
to change out of slippers when entering the
hall where prisoners slept.
Murad Dzhuraev’s health seriously
deteriorated during his extended time in
prison. His wife was allowed to visit him for
two days in July, and reported that he was
almost blind and had lost all of his teeth.
She alleged that he had not had access to
adequate medical care since 1994. The
399prison authorities had also tried to isolate him
from other prisoners by threatening to extend
the sentences of every prisoner who dared
to speak with him. He spent long periods of
time in solitary confinement as a punishment
allegedly for breaking prison rules.
At least two prisoners were reported to have
died because they had not been provided
with necessary medical care. Human rights
defender Abdurasul Khudainazarov died of
advanced terminal cancer on 26 June, three
weeks after a court ordered his early release
on humanitarian grounds. His family reported
that over a period of eight years prison
officials had repeatedly denied him necessary
medical treatment for his cancer and other
serious medical problems despite numerous
requests and clear physical indications that
his health was seriously deteriorating.
There were no independent monitoring
mechanisms in place to inspect all places
of detention and domestic or international
NGOs did not carry out any form of regular,
unannounced or unsupervised prison
monitoring. Diplomats, while granted
access to some detention facilities, were
as a rule accompanied by prison or law
enforcement officials during their visits. In
January, the authorities granted a small
number of independent human rights
activists permission to visit four imprisoned
colleagues. The human rights defenders were
accompanied by law enforcement and prison
officials and their visits were recorded on film.
One of the prisoners reported that he had
been allowed to have a hot shower before the
meeting and was given new clothes ahead of
the scheduled visit. In November, the NGO
Human Rights Watch sent a delegation to
Uzbekistan but all requests to visit prisoners
and places of detention were denied by the
authorities.
COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY
Individuals forcibly returned to Uzbekistan
in the name of national security and the
“fight against terrorism” were often held
incommunicado, increasing their risk of
400
torture or other ill-treatment. The authorities
relentlessly pursued the return of individuals
they suspected of involvement in bombings
in the capital Tashkent in 1999 and 2004,
protests in Andizhan in 2005 (during which
hundreds of people were killed when the
security forces fired on thousands of mostly
peaceful protesters), and various other acts
of violence. They accused some of being
members of banned violent Islamist groups
and also sought the extradition of political
opponents, government critics, and wealthy
individuals who had fallen out of favour with
the authorities in Tashkent.
The European Court of Human Rights
issued at least 15 judgments in 2013 and
2014 prohibiting the forcible transfer of
individuals to Uzbekistan – especially those
suspected of membership of an Islamist party
or of a group banned in the country – due to
the real risk of torture on return. The Court
ruled in October, in the case of Mamazhonov
v Russia, that the transfer of Ikromzhon
Mamazhonov from Russia to Uzbekistan
would violate Article 3 (prohibition of torture)
of the European Convention on Human
Rights. The Court noted “that there had been
no improvement in the criminal justice system
of Uzbekistan in recent years, in particular
concerning prosecution for religiously and
politically motivated crimes and that there
was certain evidence that persons accused of
such crimes were at risk of ill-treatment.”
In November, Mirsobir Khamidkariev, a
producer and businessman from Uzbekistan
who had sought asylum in Moscow, Russian
Federation, was sentenced to eight years
in prison by a court in Tashkent. 3 He was
convicted of membership of a banned
Islamist organization, a charge he strongly
denied. On 9 June he was reportedly
abducted and ill-treated by officers of the
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) from
a street in central Moscow, and handed over
to Uzbekistani law enforcement officers at an
airport in Moscow and illegally transferred to
Tashkent the following day.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Mirsobir Khamidkariev’s lawyer in Moscow
did not know his whereabouts until he
reappeared in the basement of a detention
facility run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs
in Tashkent two weeks later. According to his
Russian lawyer, who was able to get access
to him in Tashkent on 31 October, Mirsobir
Khamidkariev was subjected to torture and
other ill-treatment by law enforcement officers
in Tashkent for two months to force him to
confess to fabricated charges. He was tied
head down to a bar attached to the wall,
beaten repeatedly, and had seven of his teeth
knocked out and two of his ribs broken.

VENEZUELA
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
Head of state and government: Nicolás Maduro
Moros
The security forces used excessive force to
disperse protests. Scores of people were
arbitrarily detained and denied access to
lawyers and doctors. Torture and other
ill-treatment of protesters and passers-by
were reported. The judiciary continued
to be used to silence government critics.
Those defending human rights were
intimidated and attacked. Prison conditions
remained harsh.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
BACKGROUND
President Maduro’s first year in office was
marked by growing discontent. Between
February and July 2014, Venezuela was
shaken by mass pro- and anti-government
demonstrations in various parts of the
country. Anti-government protesters and
some opposition party leaders who called for
the resignation of the President were accused
of attempting to overthrow the government.
FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY
At least 43 people were killed and more than
870 were injured – including protesters,
security forces officials and passers-by
– during mass pro- and anti-government
protests between February and July. There
were reports of human rights violations and
of violent clashes between demonstrators
and the security forces and armed pro-
government groups. 1
More than 3,000 people were detained
in the context of the protests. Most were
charged and released after a few days. At the
end of the year over 70 people who took part
in the demonstrations remained in pre-trial
detention awaiting trial.
There were concerns that a ruling by the
Supreme Court in March, which stated that
any protest had to be pre-authorized, could
jeopardize the rights to freedoms of peaceful
assembly and association.
Excessive use of force
The security forces used excessive force
to disperse protests. Among the measures
deployed were the use of live ammunition at
close range against unarmed people; the use
of inappropriate firearms and riot equipment
that had been tampered with; and the use of
tear gas and rubber bullets in enclosed areas.
For example, in February, student Geraldín
Moreno died three days after being shot in
the eye with rubber bullets fired at close
range during a protest in Valencia, Carabobo
State. National Guard officers were charged
in connection with her death and were
awaiting trial at the end of the year. The
same month, Marvinia Jiménez was beaten
401by police officers while she was filming a
protest in Valencia and charged with, among
other things, obstructing a public road and
disturbing public order. At the end of the
year, the arrest warrant against an officer
responsible for her beating had yet to be
served. In April, 16-year-old John Michael
Ortiz Fernández was on the balcony of his
house in San Cristobal, Táchira State, when
a police officer fired a rubber bullet at the
youth; the retina of his left eye was burned.
At the end of the year, the case was under
investigation.
Arbitrary arrests and detentions
Scores of people detained during the protests
between February and July were arbitrarily
detained. Many were denied access to
a lawyer of their choice and to medical
assistance during the first 48 hours of their
detention before appearing before a judge.
Lawyer Marcelo Crovato and human rights
defender Rosmit Mantilla were detained in
April and May respectively, in relation to the
protests. More than eight months after their
arrest they remained in pre-trial detention, in
spite of the lack of solid evidence to support
the charges against them.
Torture and other ill-treatment
Torture and ill-treatment remained a concern
despite some progress brought about
by the 2013 Special Law to Prevent and
Punish Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment. 2
Student Daniel Quintero was beaten and
threatened with being burned alive while
in detention. He was arrested on his way
from an anti-government demonstration
in February in Maracaibo, Zulia State. An
investigation into the allegations of torture was
continuing at the end of the year. 3
At least 23 people were detained during
a joint National Guard and army operation
in Rubio, Táchira State, on 19 March. While
in detention they were kicked, beaten and
threatened with death and sexual violence. All
the detainees, both men and women, were
held in the same room and kept blindfolded
for several hours. They could hear those near
402
them being beaten. At least one detainee
was forced to watch while another detainee
was beaten. Gloria Tobón was doused with
water and then electric shocks were applied
to her arms, breasts and genitals. She was
threatened and told that she would be killed
and buried in pieces. At the end of the year,
the investigation into the allegations of torture
had not concluded.
Wuaddy Moreno Duque was detained in
February in La Grita, Táchira State, beaten
and burned by National Guard officers
who accused him of participating in the
protests. He and his family were the target of
intimidation after lodging a formal complaint.
HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS
Human rights defenders continued to
be attacked.
For example, two members of the
Venezuelan Prisons Observatory were
threatened and intimidated on a number
of occasions. On 12 April 2013, Marianela
Sánchez and her family received an
anonymous death threat. She lodged a
complaint, but by the end of the year the
authorities had not initiated an effective
investigation into the threat or provided the
necessary security measures, consistent with
the family’s wishes.
The authorities repeatedly attempted to
discredit Humberto Prado’s human rights
work and accused him of involvement in
violence during the protests and of conspiracy
to destabilize the government and the
prison system.
JUSTICE SYSTEM
The justice system was subject to government
interference, especially in cases involving
government critics or those who were
perceived to act in a way contrary to the
authorities’ interests.
For example, Judge María Lourdes Afiuni
Mora – who had been detained in December
2010, hours after ordering the release of a
banker charged with corruption, a decision
publicly condemned by former President
Amnesty International Report 2014/15Chávez – was awaiting trial at the end of the
year. She was released on bail in June 2013
for humanitarian reasons.
Leopoldo López, leader of the opposition
Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) party,
remained in detention, despite the lack of
evidence to support the charges against him,
which appeared to be politically motivated. He
faced charges of arson, damage to property,
incitement to commit an offence and
conspiracy to commit a crime, which carry
sentences of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. 4
In August, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention stated that his detention was
arbitrary and called for his release.
The UN Working Group also called for
the immediate release of Daniel Ceballos, a
Voluntad Popular member and Mayor of San
Cristobal, Táchira State. He was arrested in
March and was awaiting trial on charges of
rebellion and conspiracy to commit a crime in
connection with the February anti-government
protests. 5
INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE
In September 2013, following its denunciation
of the American Convention on Human Rights
a year earlier, Venezuela ceased to come
under the jurisdiction of the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights. As a result, victims
of human rights violations and their relatives
no longer have access to the Inter-American
Court if the national judicial system fails to
guarantee their rights.
IMPUNITY
Impunity remained a concern. Victims and
their families were threatened and attacked.
For example, investigations and judicial
proceedings relating to the killings of
members of the Barrios family in Aragua State
made little progress. The Barrios family has
been the target of threats and intimidation for
nearly two decades because of their demands
for justice. Ten members of the family were
killed between 1998 and May 2013 in
circumstances suggesting the involvement of
members of the police. In only one case, that
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
of Narciso Barrios, two police officers were
convicted. Other family members have been
subjected to intimidation and attacks by the
police, in spite of the protection measures
granted to the family since 2004 by the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights and
more recently by the Inter-American Court
of Human Rights. 6 At the end of the year, it
was not known whether investigations had
been initiated into any of the complaints of
intimidation by police officers.
PRISON CONDITIONS
In spite of reforms to the prison system,
prison conditions remained harsh. Lack
of medical care, food and clean drinking
water, unhygienic conditions, overcrowding
and violence in prisons and police stations
remained a concern. Firearms and other
weapons continued to be routinely used in
prison clashes.
In the first half of the year local human
rights organizations reported 150 deaths in
prisons and seven in police custody.
In November, two inmates were killed and
at least eight were injured when security
forces intervened to end a riot in the prison
of San Francisco de Yare, Miranda State, in
protest at the harsh prison conditions and
ill-treatment of inmates.
In September, after three years and a
number of delays in transferring him to a
hospital where his medical needs could be
assessed, a court granted former Police
Commissioner Iván Simonovis permission
to receive medical treatment at home under
house arrest. He was reported to be suffering
from a number of health problems caused by
the conditions in which he had been held.

VIET NAM
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam
Head of state: Truong Tan Sang
Head of government: Nguyen Tan Dung
Severe restrictions on freedoms of
expression, association and peaceful
assembly continued. The state continued
to control the media and the judiciary, as
well as political and religious institutions.
Scores of prisoners of conscience remained
imprisoned in harsh conditions after unfair
trials in previous years. They included
bloggers, labour and land rights activists,
political activists, religious followers,
members of ethnic groups and advocates
for human rights and social justice. 1 New
arrests and trials of bloggers and human
rights activists took place. The authorities
attempted to curtail the activities of
unauthorized civil society groups through
harassment, surveillance and restrictions
on freedom of movement. Security officers
harassed and physically attacked peaceful
activists, and held them in short-term
detention. The death penalty was retained
for a wide range of offences.
404
BACKGROUND
Viet Nam was elected to the UN Human
Rights Council in January for a two-year
term. In June Viet Nam rejected 45 of 227
recommendations made by the Working
Group on the UN Universal Periodic
Review in February. These included key
recommendations on human rights defenders
and dissidents, freedom of expression and the
death penalty, among others.
The territorial conflict in the East China
Sea escalated in May when China moved an
exploration oil rig into disputed waters. The
incident sparked anti-China riots by tens of
thousands of workers at industrial parks in
several provinces in southern and central Viet
Nam. Chinese-owned factories were targeted,
but Taiwanese, Korean and Japanese
factories were also damaged and looted. An
unconfirmed number of people were killed
and injured, and around 700 people were
arrested for their involvement.
An Amnesty International delegation
visited Viet Nam for official meetings in
February. During his visit in July, the UN
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or
belief found evidence of serious violations,
including police raids, disruption of religious
ceremonies, beatings and assaults of
members of independent religious groups.
Some individuals he was due to meet were
subject to intimidation, harassment and
surveillance by security officials.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
The new Constitution, adopted in November
2013, came into force after an unprecedented
but heavily controlled consultation process
lasting around nine months. The Constitution
provides a general protection of the rights
to freedom of expression, association and
peaceful assembly but limits them by vague
and broad provisions in national legislation.
Only a limited guarantee of fair trial rights
is included.
Viet Nam signed the UN Convention
against Torture in November 2013 and held
Amnesty International Report 2014/15several preparatory workshops during 2014;
the National Assembly voted for ratification in
November. Although torture is prohibited in
the new Constitution, legislation contains no
clear definition of what constitutes torture.
The National Assembly rejected a proposed
amendment to the Law on Marriage and
Family, which would have recognized same-
sex cohabitation and joint custody. The
government also announced that it would not
legally recognize same-sex marriage.
The authorities stated that several
laws relating to human rights were under
preparation for approval by the National
Assembly in 2016. They include an
amended Penal Code, the Amended Law
on the Press, the Law on Association, the
Law on Demonstrations and the Law on
Information Access.
REPRESSION OF DISSENT
Human rights activists and advocates for
social and political change increased their
peaceful activities despite the challenging
environment and risk to their personal safety.
Vaguely worded provisions of the 1999 Penal
Code continued to be used to criminalize
peaceful activism and those exercising their
rights to freedom of expression, association
and peaceful assembly.
Despite the early release of six dissidents
in April and June, 2 at least 60 prisoners of
conscience remained imprisoned. They were
convicted after unfair trials and included
peaceful bloggers, labour and land rights
activists, political activists, religious followers
and advocates for human rights and social
justice. In addition, at least 18 bloggers and
activists were tried and sentenced in six
trials to between 15 months’ and three years’
imprisonment under Article 258 of the Penal
Code for “abusing democratic freedoms to
infringe on the interests of the state”.
Blogger Nguyen Huu Vinh and his
associate Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy were
arrested in May and held under Article 258 of
the Penal Code for “posting false information
on the internet”. Nguyen Huu Vinh, a former
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
policeman, is well known for setting up the
popular Ba Sam website in 2007, which
included articles on a range of social and
political issues. Three more prominent
bloggers were arrested between 29 November
and 27 December – Vietnamese-Japanese
Professor Hong Le Tho, writer Nguyen Quang
Lap and Nguyen Dinh Ngoc had written or
posted articles criticizing government officials
and policies.
Violent unprovoked physical attacks
were carried out against activists by men
suspected to be acting on the order of or in
collusion with security forces. For example,
in May human rights lawyer and former
prisoner of conscience Nguyen Van Dai was
attacked by a group of five men while he was
in a café with friends. He sustained a head
injury requiring stitches. The same month,
blogger and human rights activist Tran Thi
Nga was attacked by five assailants while on
a motorcycle with her two young children.
She suffered a broken arm and knee and
other injuries. Activists attempting to observe
the trial of three human rights defenders in
August were harassed, beaten and arrested
by security officials. 3 Three other activists
were assaulted in October. In November
independent journalist Truong Min Duc was
attacked and beaten for the third time in two
months, sustaining serious injuries.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
Several peaceful activists were prevented
from travelling to attend Viet Nam’s
consideration under the Universal Periodic
Review in Geneva, Switzerland, in February.
They were summoned for questioning by the
police and their passports were confiscated.
Others were detained for questioning on their
return. Do Thi Minh Hanh, a labour rights
activist and former prisoner of conscience
released in June, was stopped at the airport
and prevented from travelling to Austria to
visit her seriously ill mother in August; she
was subsequently allowed to go in October.
Activists attempting to attend informal civil
society meetings, foreign embassy meetings
405and to observe dissident trials were harassed,
intimidated and prevented from leaving their
homes. Individuals reported being held under
de facto house arrest.

PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE
Conditions of detention for prisoners of
conscience were harsh, including lack of
adequate medical care and nutritious food.
Some were subject to ill-treatment by other
prisoners without intervention by prison
guards, and to incommunicado detention.
Family visits were conducted in the presence
of guards who prohibited discussion of
perceived sensitive subjects. Prisoners were
sometimes moved without their families being
informed, and some were held in prisons
distant from their homes, making family visits
difficult. Some prisoners were encouraged
to “confess” to the offences for which they
were convicted in order to be considered
for release.
Environment activist and prisoner of
conscience Dinh Dang Dinh died of stomach
cancer in April following his temporary
release from prison on medical grounds in
February. Despite appeals from his family and
the diplomatic community, the authorities
failed to provide adequate access to medical
treatment while he was serving his six-year
prison sentence. 4
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty was retained for murder,
drugs offences, treason and crimes against
humanity. At least three executions by lethal
injection were reported. The number of
people on death row was estimated to be
more than 650. The government did not
provide accurate figures, and statistics on
the death penalty remained classified as a
state secret.

YEMEN
Republic of Yemen
Head of state: Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi
Head of government: Khaled Bahah (assumed office
in October following dismissal of Mohammed
Salim Basindwa in September)
Government forces committed human rights
violations, including unlawful killings and
enforced disappearances, against supporters
of secession in the south and amid renewed
conflict with Huthi rebels in the north,
who also committed abuses. Impunity
prevailed and no progress was achieved in
putting an end to political assassinations or
addressing abuses committed in the past.
Security forces dispersed peaceful protests
in both Sana’a and southern cities using
excessive force. Freedom of expression
suffered as a result of ongoing attacks and
other violations targeting journalists and
media outlets. Women continued to face
discrimination and high levels of domestic
and other gender-based violence. Armed
opposition groups carried out indiscriminate
bombings and committed other abuses. US
forces used drone strikes against suspected
al-Qa’ida militants, resulting in deaths and
injuries to civilians.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15BACKGROUND
The process of political transition ignited by
the popular uprising of 2011 continued but
remained fragile. On 26 February, the UN
Security Council passed Resolution 2140,
creating sanctions targeting individuals
and organizations seen as obstructing
the transition.
The outbreak of renewed hostilities
between the government and the Huthis, a
Zaidi Shi’a armed group based in the Sa’ada
and ‘Amran governorates, posed a major
threat to the transition process. In September,
one day after signing a UN-brokered
agreement to bring an end to the fighting,
Huthi forces seized control of much of the
capital Sana’a.
The 10 months-long National Dialogue
Conference (NDC), which brought together
565 representatives of rival political
parties and movements and civil society
organizations, including women’s and
youth groups, concluded on 25 January. It
generated over 1,800 recommendations,
including some advocating greater protection
for rights, and concluded that Yemen
should become a federal state with a new
Constitution.
In June, during the UN Universal Periodic
Review of Yemen, government representatives
confirmed that Yemen would become a party
to the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court and the International
Convention against enforced disappearance.
At the end of the year, parliament had still
to adopt legislation to give effect to these
ratifications.
The government failed to undertake
significant reform of the army and two
security agencies – National Security and
Political Security – which were implicated in
serious human rights violations and reported
directly to the President.
ARMED CONFLICT
The year saw a continuing deterioration
in security across the country, marked by
killings of government and senior military
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
officials, abductions of foreign nationals
and other individuals, and resurgent
armed conflict.
In the north, dozens were killed and
hundreds wounded during armed clashes
that began in 2013 between the Huthis and
supporters of the Sunni Islamist al-Islah party
and the Salafi al-Rashad party in the town of
Dammaj in Sa’ada governorate. Thousands
of al-Rashad supporters from Dammaj,
mainly the families of students studying at the
al-Rashad-affiliated Dar al-Hadith religious
institute, were forcibly displaced after a
ceasefire agreement in January 2014. Despite
the ceasefire agreement, the fighting spread
southward and by mid-2014 Huthi fighters
had clashed with their opponents and the
Yemeni army and taken over most of the
‘Amran, Hajja and al-Jawf governorates. In
September, Huthi forces attacked and took
control of much of Sana’a after fighting in
which over 270 people died and hundreds
were wounded. Armed Huthi fighters in
the capital looted army units, government
buildings, political party headquarters, media
outlets and the private homes of al-Islah
party members. Later, despite agreeing to
a ceasefire and joining a new government
formed in November, Huthi forces moved
south of Sana’a and clashed with local
army units, tribesmen, and armed fighters
affiliated with the armed group al-Qa’ida in
the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). In response,
AQAP carried out attacks in Sana’a and other
cities, which killed and injured many civilians,
including children.
In the south, government forces clashed
with AQAP fighters, who mounted suicide
and other attacks targeting government
installations, including an attack on 5
December 2013 that killed at least 57 people,
including staff and patients, at a military
hospital in Sana’a. In June, AQAP also
attacked an army checkpoint in Shabwah,
killing eight Yemeni army soldiers and six
tribesmen assisting them. AQAP said the
attacks were in response to US drone strikes
on its forces, carried out with the support
407of the Yemeni government. The Yemeni
army attacked AQAP positions in Abyan and
Shabwa governorates in April; the ensuing
fighting reportedly caused the forcible
displacement of some 20,000 people. US
military forces also attacked AQAP, carrying
out drone strikes that targeted and killed
AQAP militants, and also reportedly caused
the death and injury of an unknown number
of civilians. In December, an attempt by
US military forces to free Luke Somers, a
journalist held hostage by AQAP, resulted in
his death and that of another hostage.
Both government forces and armed
opposition groups recruited and used child
soldiers, according to a report by the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights in August,
despite efforts to ban the practice.
POLITICAL KILLINGS
Assassinations targeting political figures and
security officials continued. On 21 January,
one of the most prominent Huthi leaders,
Ahmed Sharaf el-Din, was assassinated on
his way to the National Dialogue Conference
in Sana’a. In November, masked gunmen
shot dead Dr Mohammad Abdul-Malik
al-Mutawwakkil, a prominent political figure
and university professor, in a Sana'a street.
Between mid-2012 and the end of 2014, over
100 military officials and security officers were
assassinated and dozens of others survived
attempted assassinations. Those responsible
for most of these killings were not identified
and no report of any prosecutions of alleged
perpetrators was received.
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
On 9 September, army soldiers in Sana’a
opened fire on a crowd of Huthi protesters
demanding a change of government, killing
at least seven and wounding others. Two days
earlier, security forces had opened fire on
Huthi demonstrators on the airport road in
Sana’a, killing at least two peaceful protesters.
Investigations were announced into some
incidents of excessive force used to disperse
demonstrations in the south (see below) and
408
also in Sana’a on 9 June 2013, which led to
the deaths of at least 13 demonstrators and
the wounding of over 50. The outcome of the
investigations remained unclear at the end of
the year.
REPRESSION OF DISSENT
– SOUTHERN YEMEN
Serious unrest continued in Aden and
surrounding areas. Some Southern Movement
(al-Hirak al-Janoubi) factions participated
in the NDC. Demonstrators in Aden and
other cities continued to call for the south to
secede and held strikes and other protests,
some of which the army responded to with
excessive and unlawful lethal force. On 21
February, security forces used excessive force
to disperse demonstrations in al-Mukallah city
and in Aden, causing two deaths and injuring
over 20 protesters.
On 27 December 2013 the army’s 33rd
armoured brigade killed dozens of peaceful
mourners at al-Sanah in al-Dale’ governorate,
prompting the President to announce an
official investigation, the outcome of which
had not been disclosed by the end of 2014.
The same army brigade reportedly killed
and injured more civilians in apparently
indiscriminate shelling and other attacks in
early 2014, including one on 16 January that
killed 10 civilians, including two children,
and wounded 20 other civilians in apparent
reprisal for a Southern Movement attack on
an army checkpoint in al-Dale’.
Government security forces arrested
Southern Movement activists in Aden and
other cities, subjecting some to enforced
disappearance. On 31 August, Khaled
al-Junaidi was beaten and then dragged
into a car by unidentified gunmen, whom
witnesses assumed were security officials.
He then disappeared. The authorities did not
acknowledge his detention and his family was
unable to establish his fate or whereabouts.
Security forces had previously detained him
on at least four occasions, including for three
weeks in November 2013 when he was kept
in solitary confinement. He was released
Amnesty International Report 2014/15on 27 November, but was shot and killed,
apparently by a member of the security
forces, on 15 December.
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In November 2013, amendments to the
Judicial Authority Law handed powers
previously exercised by the Ministry of Justice
to the Supreme Judicial Council, enhancing
judicial independence. New measures in
2014 included a draft law to create a National
Human Rights Commission and a proposed
Child Rights Law. The latter would, among
other reforms, address the problem of early
marriage by setting the minimum age of
marriage at 18, prohibit the use of the death
penalty on children under 18, and criminalize
female genital mutilation. Both draft laws were
awaiting enactment at the end of the year.
On 8 March, the President issued
Presidential Decrees 26/2014 and 27/2014
establishing the Constitutional Drafting
Commission and naming its 17 members.
Under the Decrees, the Commission
was granted a year to finish drafting the
Constitution to be followed by public
consultations and a referendum.
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Journalists and other media workers were
subject to threats and physical attacks
by government forces and unidentified
armed men. On 11 June, the Presidential
Guard raided the Yemen Today satellite TV
channel, forcing it to cease broadcasting,
and closed down Yemen Today newspaper,
apparently without authorization from the
Public Prosecutor. Local media freedom
organizations said they had recorded 146
incidents in the first half of 2014 of threats,
attacks or other abuses against journalists.
Armed Huthi fighters raided a number of
media outlets in Sana’a in September and
forcibly closed them down.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
IMPUNITY
The authorities made little progress in
addressing the widespread human rights
abuses of previous years.
The government took no steps to clarify
the fate of hundreds of political activists
and others who were subjected to enforced
disappearance under the former regime,
headed for decades by former President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, or to bring those responsible
to justice, despite the reappearance of a
number of people forcibly disappeared
decades earlier.
Transitional justice
After numerous drafts that fell far short of
safeguarding justice and accountability for
past crimes, a draft Law on Transitional
Justice and National Reconciliation, created
at the NDC’s behest, was submitted for
cabinet approval in May but had not been
made law by the end of the year. Similarly,
at the end of the year, the President had still
to appoint the members of a Commission of
Inquiry to investigate human rights violations
committed during the 2011 uprising, which
he had announced in September 2012. Two
other commissions that the President had
announced in 2013 were inundated with
claims. One, tasked with addressing the
issue of land confiscation in southern Yemen
in the 1990s, had received over 100,000
claims by May while the other, set up to
review the forced dismissal of southerners
from government employment, had registered
93,000 claims by the same time. Neither,
however, appeared sufficiently resourced to
address and resolve the claims they received.
WOMEN’S AND GIRLS’ RIGHTS
Women and girls continued to face
discrimination in both law and practice,
notably in relation to marriage, divorce, child
custody and inheritance. They also faced high
levels of domestic and other gender-specific
violence. Early marriage and forced marriages
continued and in some areas female genital
mutilation was widely practised.
409The NDC recommended that universities
and other higher education institutions
should reserve 30% of places for the
admission of women students, and that the
new Constitution should require government
agencies to operate a 30% quota for
employing women.
REFUGEES' AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS
Yemen dealt with a large flow of refugees,
asylum-seekers and migrants seeking safety,
protection or economic opportunities during
the year. Many entered Yemen after crossing
by boat from Ethiopia and Somalia. Transit
and reception centres were fully managed
by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and
its implementing partners without the
government taking an active role.
DEATH PENALTY
The death penalty remained in force for a
wide range of crimes. Courts continued to
impose death sentences and executions were
carried out. Prisoners on death row reportedly
included dozens of juvenile offenders
sentenced for crimes committed while they
were under 18 years of age.
ZAMBIA
Republic of Zambia
Head of state and government: Guy Scott (replaced
Michael Chilufya Sata in October as acting
President)
The human rights situation continued to
decline under the late President Sata’s
government. Fundamental freedoms came
under attack, with political opponents,
civil society and sexual minorities being
systematically targeted.
410
BACKGROUND
Guy Scott became acting President following
the death of President Sata in October.
Tensions within the ruling Patriotic Front
to elect a presidential candidate for the
presidential by-election set for 20 January
2015 resulted in some violent protests by rival
party supporters.
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,
ASSOCIATION AND ASSEMBLY
In January, the leader of the opposition
Alliance for Better Zambia party, Frank
Bwalya, was arrested and charged with
defamation for allegedly comparing President
Sata to a sweet potato during a live radio
broadcast. The authorities alleged that Frank
Bwalya had used a Bemba (Bantu language)
idiom used to describe a person who does not
take advice. He was acquitted by the Kasama
Principal Magistrate in July in a ruling that
upheld his freedom of speech.
In February, a Lusaka court acquitted
human rights activist Paul Kasonkomona.
He had been charged in April 2013 with
“soliciting for immoral purposes” after he
urged the government to recognize the rights
of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and
intersex people as part of a comprehensive
fight against HIV/AIDS during a television
debate. The court ruled that the state had
failed to prove its case. The government
indicated its intention to appeal against
the ruling.
Also in February, 460 NGOs resolved not
to register under the Non-Governmental
Organizations Act of 2009, the provisions of
which may be deemed unconstitutional due
to restrictions on freedoms of association and
movement. The government had announced
in 2013 that NGOs failing to register under
the Act would not be allowed to operate.
On 12 March, 49 young people were
arrested by police during a march to
commemorate Youth Day in the capital
Lusaka. The young activists were arrested
for wearing T-shirts and carrying placards
bearing the message “Give us our constitution
Amnesty International Report 2014/15now”. They were separated and detained for
at least six hours, before being cautioned and
released. Four of the youths were reportedly
assaulted by police officers who beat them
with their fists during their detention at
Lusaka Central Police Station, resulting in one
sustaining a serious ear injury. The activists
were allegedly forced to remove their T-shirts,
leaving some, including young women,
partially undressed.
RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL,
TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX PEOPLE
Individuals were harassed, intimidated
and prosecuted for their real or perceived
sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTI
individuals continued to live in fear as a
result of homophobic attacks backed by the
authorities. Following statements by senior
government officials in 2013 urging people
to report LGBTI people in their communities,
individuals continued to suffer harassment
and intimidation by their relatives, their
communities and the police. Most suffered
quietly with no support or protection from
the state.
On 3 July 2014, a court in the town of
Kapiri Mposhi acquitted two men charged
under the country’s anti-sodomy laws. James
Mwape and Philip Mubiana were released
after being held in custody for over a year.
They denied the charge of “having sex against
the order of nature”. The judge found that
the state had not proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. The two men, both aged
22, were first arrested on 25 April 2013,
and detained until 2 May 2013, when they
were released on bail. They were rearrested
on 5 May 2013 and forced to undergo anal
examinations – which violate the prohibition
of torture and other ill-treatment – by
government doctors.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
ZIMBABWE
Republic of Zimbabwe
Head of state and government: Robert Gabriel
Mugabe
The executive continued to enforce old
unconstitutional laws including those
limiting the rights to freedoms of expression,
association and assembly. Violations of
economic and social rights continued,
including forced evictions in rural and
urban areas. Mass job losses occurred as
companies closed due to an unfavourable
economic climate. Intra-party violence
was recorded in the ruling ZANU-PF party
and the main opposition party. There were
reports of torture by the police.
BACKGROUND
Despite adopting a new Constitution in 2013
most laws that were rendered unconstitutional
by the new Constitution remained in
operation. The economy continued to lose
the traction gained during the period of the
Government of National Unity (February
2009 to August 2013). Intra-party jostling for
positions within President Mugabe’s ruling
ZANU-PF party came to a head towards
the party’s sixth congress in December
2014. The intra-party tension, mainly fuelled
by the uncertainty over the succession
of the 91-year-old President, resulted in
violent clashes during faction-sponsored
demonstrations. Nine provincial chairpersons
lost their positions, including party stalwarts
Joice Mujuru (who was also the country’s
Vice-President), Rugare Gumbo, Nicholas
Goche, Webster Shamu and Olivia Muchena,
in an unprecedented purge of party structures
fronted by President Mugabe’s wife, Grace
Mugabe. The purge created a sense of
uncertainty and government ministers were
split into two main factions.
411REPRESSION OF DISSENT
The Zimbabwe Republic Police continued
to use brutal force and torture against
anti-Mugabe protesters and human rights
defenders. Intra-party violence was recorded
in both the ruling ZANU-PF party and
the main opposition party, the Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC-T) led by
Morgan Tsvangirai.
State institutions’ abuse against political
opponents continued mainly in the context of
factional rivalry within ZANU-PF. The police
were used to arrest perceived opponents and
prosecutions were brought on apparently
politically motivated charges. For example,
Jabulani Sibanda, a former war veterans’
leader, was arrested on 27 November
for refusing to attend Grace Mugabe’s
provincial rallies where other party leaders
were denounced. He was charged under
Section 33 of the Criminal Law (Reform
and Codification) Act for “undermining the
authority of the President”, then released
on bail. Jabulani Sibanda had reportedly
accused President Mugabe of “attempting
to stage a coup both in the boardroom
and bedroom” in reference to his wife’s
appointment to the position of leader of
ZANU-PF’s women’s league.
Deposed ZANU-PF party spokesperson
Rugare Gumbo was questioned by police
on allegations related to ongoing factional
fights. It was reported that he had been
interrogated on his links with a political online
blogger known as Baba Jukwa on Facebook.
Edmund Kudzayi, editor of a state-controlled
newspaper, was arrested and faced several
sedition charges which he denied. He was
also accused of being linked to the same
online blogger. The blogger had more than
400,000 followers and was involved in a
naming and shaming campaign against
ZANU-PF officials before the July 2013
elections. The trial continued at the end of
the year.
On 6 November, journalist and pro-
democracy activist Itai Dzamara was brutally
attacked by anti-riot police in Harare and
412
left unconscious. He collapsed on admission
to hospital and had to be resuscitated and
admitted to the intensive care unit. As leader
of the Occupy Africa Unity Square (OAUS)
protest group, Itai Dzamara had submitted
a petition to President Mugabe in October
calling on him to resign. The group staged a
sit-in protest in Harare’s Africa Unity Square,
a park adjacent to Parliament. Kennedy
Masiye from the Zimbabwe Lawyers for
Human Rights, who had responded to a call
by the activists, was also beaten by anti-riot
police despite identifying himself as a lawyer
representing his client Itai Dzamara. Police
threw away Kennedy Masiye's practising
certificate and assaulted him; he suffered a
broken arm and was hospitalized.
On 26 November, four members of OAUS,
Tichaona Danho, Charles Nyoni, Terry
Manzini and Shungu Mutize, were arrested
and detained after submitting a petition to
the Speaker of Parliament and staging a
peaceful protest in the Speaker’s gallery.
They were severely beaten and released
without charge after six hours. At the police
station, the men were ordered to undress.
Three officers whipped them, ordered them
to beat each other, demanded to know their
group’s mission and implored them to stop
protesting against President Mugabe. Efforts
by human rights lawyers to represent them
were frustrated by police officials who denied
holding the men. Later they were ordered to
dress, go home and not inform anyone about
their detention.
Prominent MDC-T activist and former MP
Job Sikhala was arrested on 27 November.
He was released the following day and
summoned to report back on 29 November.
Job Sikhala reported with his lawyers, who
were barred from accompanying him during
interrogation, and was allegedly tortured. He
was hospitalized soon after his release.
There was continued abuse of Section 121
of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act
(CPEA), which allowed the authorities to veto
bail granted by the courts to accused persons
for seven days pending an appeal. On 22
Amnesty International Report 2014/15August, the state prosecutor invoked Section
121 to delay the release of six MDC-T party
activists and MP Ronia Bunjira, who had
been arrested during protests demanding the
fulfilment of ZANU-PF’s pre-election pledge to
create 2 million jobs. The opposition activists
were accused of contravening the CPEA for
allegedly obstructing or endangering free
movement of persons or traffic. Angela Jimu,
a journalist who was covering the opposition
march, was beaten by police and had her
cameras confiscated. She was detained by
police. Section 121 was challenged in several
cases before the Constitutional Court as it
amounted to arbitrary denial of the right to
liberty for accused persons, particularly in
cases involving ZANU-PF opponents and
human rights defenders.
Sixteen activists from the opposition
Transform Zimbabwe party were detained
in April for about five hours in Tsholotsho
for distributing political material and were
released without charge. The party’s leader,
Jacob Ngarivhume, continued to face
charges under Section 24(6) of the draconian
Public Order and Security Act (POSA).
Police claimed that Jacob Ngarivhume
addressed an unsanctioned political meeting
when he delivered a sermon at a church
in June, where he had been invited for a
religious meeting.
On 14 July, 13 Transform Zimbabwe
activists were arrested in the town of Gweru
following a peaceful protest against the arrest
of Jacob Ngarivhume, who had been arrested
and detained on 12 July for convening a
party executive meeting. Jacob Ngarivhume
was charged with contravening Section 24(6)
of POSA. The 13 activists were charged
under Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law
(Codification and Reform) Act for allegedly
participating in a demonstration with the
intention or realization that there was a
risk or possibility of forcibly disturbing the
peace, security and order of the public. The
state alleged that the activists had gathered
intending to promote public violence.
Amnesty International Report 2014/15
However, they were acquitted after the state
failed to prove its case.
On 22 July, police using the POSA banned
planned marches in Bulawayo, Gweru,
Harare and Mutare by National Railways of
Zimbabwe workers, who were members of the
Zimbabwe Railway Artisans Union, to demand
payment of outstanding salaries. However, on
6 August the High Court ruled that police had
no powers to ban trade union demonstrations.
On 21 August, the Victoria Falls
Magistrates’ Court acquitted four officials
from the civil society organization Bulawayo
Agenda who were facing charges under
POSA. Mmeli Dube, Butholezwe Kgosi
Nyathi, Nthombiyezansi Mabunda Tozana
and Thulani Moyo were arrested in June and
charged with contravening Section 25(1)
(b) of POSA for allegedly failing to notify the
regulatory authority of a public meeting. The
magistrate ruled that the state had failed to
prove a case against the activists.
Abductions
In November, abductions were recorded for
the first time since 2009.
On 12 November, former ZANU-PF Harare
province chair, Jim Kunaka, was abducted
by unknown people in Mbare township. He
was reportedly forced into a car, blindfolded
and driven to a bushy area where he was
assaulted with iron bars before being
dumped. The abduction was reported at
Harare Central Police Station. Jim Kunaka’s
abduction took place at a time of intense
jockeying for positions within ZANU-PF.
On 2 December, pro-democracy activists
Allan Chinewaita, Jerry Mugweni and Itai
Dzamara were abducted by men in three
cars while engaging in a peaceful protest
in Harare. They were reportedly taken to
ZANU-PF headquarters and were robbed,
slapped, beaten and spat at by party youths.
They were then driven to Harare Central
Police Station where they were handed to
security agents who tortured them before
releasing them without charge. They were
hospitalized with severe injuries.
413HOUSING RIGHTS – FORCED EVICTIONS
Despite provisions in Section 74 of the
Constitution protecting people from arbitrary
evictions, the government and local
authorities carried out evictions without
court orders.
On 25 September, Harare City Council
served 324 “illegal settlers” with 48-hour
eviction notices: a completely inadequate
timeframe. In September, the Council
demolished informal business structures
in the city centre without a court order,
threatening family livelihoods dependent on
the informal sector, as the economy shrank
with over 80% formal unemployment.
In August, the authorities forcibly shut
down Chingwizi Holding Camp, established
to accommodate an estimated 20,000 people
displaced by the floods in Chivi district in
early 2014, resulting from the construction
of the Tokwe-Mukosi dam. The crisis at the
camp was a result of the government’s failure
to plan for the relocation of the flood victims
that saw them living in deplorable conditions
lacking basic services including adequate
access to clean water. The government
restricted humanitarian access by barring
NGOs from the settlement. The closure was
carried out amid protests against attempts to
close the camp clinic which turned violent.
The authorities responded by using brutal
force, beating villagers and indiscriminately
arresting some 300 people, mainly men
and community leaders, to facilitate the
forcible relocation of women and children to
one-hectare plots from which they had no
possibility of deriving viable livelihoods. Thirty
people were charged with committing public
violence in contravention of Section 36 of
the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform)
Act. Twenty-six of the villagers were granted
bail on 8 August. Another villager, Sophia
Tagwireyi, was granted bail in September
while two spent three months in custody
before being granted bail. Patrick Chineunda
Changwesha remained in detention at the
end of the year. The detainees alleged they
had been tortured by police while in custody.
414
Twenty-six of the villagers were acquitted
in December.
In September, hundreds of family homes
were demolished by the Epworth Local Board
and Chitungwiza Town Council with police
support, and without court orders. Evictions
were carried out at night with no time
provided for residents to remove belongings.
Police used tear gas during the demolitions.
At least 30 people were arrested and released
without charge and 12 people were injured.
The evictions in Epworth were stopped
through a High Court order.
