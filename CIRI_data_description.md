**[PHYSINT] Physical Integrity Rights Index **This is an additive index constructed from the Torture, Extrajudicial Killing, Political Imprisonment, and Disappearance indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these four rights) to 8 (full government respect for these four rights). Details on its construction and use can be found in: David L. Cingranelli and David L. Richards. 1999. "Measuring the Level, Pattern, and Sequence of Government Respect for Physical Integrity Rights." International Studies Quarterly, Vol 43.2: 407-18.

**[DISAP] Disappearance **Disappearances are cases in which people have disappeared, political motivation appears likely, and the victims have not been found. Knowledge of the whereabouts of the disappeared is, by definition, not public knowledge. However, while there is typically no way of knowing where victims are, it is typically known by whom they were taken and under what circumstances. A score of 0 indicates that disappearances have occurred frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that disappearances occasionally occurred; and a score of 2 indicates that disappearances did not occur in a given year.

**[KILL] Extrajudicial Killing **Extrajudicial killings are killings by government officials without due process of law. They include murders by private groups _if _instigated by government. These killings may result from the deliberate, illegal, and excessive use of lethal force by the police, security forces, or other agents of the state whether against criminal suspects, detainees, prisoners, or others. A score of 0 indicates that extrajudicial killings were practiced frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that extrajudicial killings were practiced occasionally; and a score of 2 indicates that such killings did not occur in a given year.

**[POLPRIS] Political Imprisonment **Political imprisonment refers to the incarceration of people by government officials because of: their speech; their non-violent opposition to government policies or leaders; their religious beliefs; their non-violent religious practices including proselytizing; or their membership in a group, including an ethnic or racial group. A score of 0 indicates that there were many people imprisoned because of their religious, political, or other beliefs in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that a few people were imprisoned; and a score of 2 indicates that no persons were imprisoned for any of the above reasons in a given year.

**[TORT] Torture **Torture refers to the purposeful inflicting of extreme pain, whether mental or physical, by government officials or by private individuals at the instigation of government officials. Torture includes the use of physical and other force by police and prison guards that is cruel, inhuman, or degrading. This also includes deaths in custody due to negligence by government officials. A score of 0 indicates that torture was practiced frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates that torture was practiced occasionally; and a score of 2 indicates that torture did not occur in a given year.

**[OLD_EMPINX] Empowerment Rights Index **This is an additive index constructed from the Freedom of Movement, Freedom of Speech, Workers’ Rights, Political Participation, and Freedom of Religion indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these five rights) to 10 (full government respect for these five rights).<sup>1 </sup>Details on its construction can be found in: David L. Richards, Ronald Gelleny, and David Sacko. 2001. "Money With A Mean Streak? Foreign Economic Penetration and Government Respect for Human Rights in Developing Countries" International Studies Quarterly.45.2: 219-239. **[Note: Starting with the 2007 coding, this variable was retired in favor of the newer index NEW_EMPINX] **

**[NEW_EMPINX] Empowerment Rights Index **This is an additive index constructed from the Foreign Movement, Domestic Movement, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly & Association, Workers’ Rights, Electoral Self- Determination, and Freedom of Religion indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these seven rights) to 14 (full government respect for these seven rights).

**[ASSN] Freedom of Assembly and Association **It is an internationally recognized right of citizens to assemble freely and to associate with other persons in political parties, trade unions, cultural organizations, or other special-interest groups. This variable indicates the extent to which the freedoms of assembly and association are subject to actual governmental limitations or restrictions (as opposed to strictly legal protections). A score of 0 indicates that citizens’ rights to freedom of assembly or association were severely restricted or denied completely to all citizens; a score of 1 indicates that these rights were limited for all citizens or severely restricted or denied for select groups; and a score of 2 indicates that these rights were virtually unrestricted and freely enjoyed by practically all citizens in a given year.

**[FORMOV] Freedom of Foreign Movement **This variable indicates citizens’ freedom to leave and return to their country. A score of 0 indicates that this freedom was severely restricted, a score of 1 indicates the freedom was somewhat restricted, and a score of 2 indicates unrestricted freedom of foreign movement. **[NOTE: This indicator is new for 2007 and will be back-coded for years 1981-2006 as quickly as resources allow.] **

**[DOMMOV] Freedom of Domestic Movement **This variable indicates citizens’ freedom to travel within their own country. A score of 0 indicates that this freedom was severely restricted, a score of 1 indicates the freedom was somewhat restricted, and a score of 2 indicates unrestricted freedom of foreign movement. **[NOTE: This indicator is new for 2007 and will be back-coded for years 1981-2006 as quickly as resources allow.] **

1 <sub>The top of the score range in this older version was 10, because the two dichotomous indicators that were used in </sub>this older version, religion and movement, were rescaled 0-2 for purposes of Mokken Scaling Analysis, which required an identical range for all variables.

**[OLD_MOVE] Freedom of Movement **This variable indicates citizens’ freedom to travel within their own country and to leave and return to that country. A score of 0 indicates that domestic and foreign travel was restricted in a given year, while a score of 1 indicates that such travel was generally unrestricted. [**NOTE: Starting with the 2007 coding, this variable was retired and became two separate variables, [DOMMOVE] Freedom of Domestic Movement and [FORMOVE] Freedom of International Movement. Data for this variable are only available through 2006.] **

**[SPEECH] Freedom of Speech **This variable indicates the extent to which freedoms of speech and press are affected by government censorship, including ownership of media outlets. Censorship is any form of restriction that is placed on freedom of the press, speech or expression. Expression may be in the form of art or music. A score of 0 indicates that government censorship of the media was complete; a score of 1 indicates that there was some government censorship of the media; and a score of 2 indicates that there was no government censorship of the media in a given year.

**[ELECSD] Electoral Self-Determination (Formerly known as FFELECT or Free and Fair Elections) (Formerly Known as POLPAR or Political Participation) **This variable indicates to what extent citizens enjoy freedom of political choice and the legal right and ability in practice to change the laws and officials that govern them through free and fair elections. This right is sometimes known as the right to self-determination. A score of 0 indicates that the right to self-determination through free and fair elections did not exist in law or practice during the year in question. A score of 1 indicates that while citizens had the legal right to self-determination, there were some limitations to the fulfillment of this right in practice. Therefore, in states receiving a 1, political participation was only moderately free and open. A score of 2 indicates that political participation was very free and open during the year in question and citizens had the right to self-determination through free and fair elections in both law and practice.

**[NEW_RELFRE] Freedom of Religion **This variable indicates the extent to which the freedom of citizens to exercise and practice their religious beliefs is subject to actual government restrictions. Citizens should be able to freely practice their religion and proselytize (attempt to convert) other citizens to their religion as long as such attempts are done in a non-coercive, peaceful manner. A score of 0 indicates that government restrictions on religious practices are severe and widespread. A score of 1 indicates such practices are moderate, and a 0 indicates such practices are practically absent. **[NOTE: This indicator is new for 2007 and will be back-coded for years 1981-2006 as quickly as resources allow.] **

**[OLD_RELFRE] Freedom of Religion **This variable indicates the extent to which the freedom of citizens to exercise and practice their religious beliefs is subject to actual government restrictions. Citizens should be able to freely practice their religion and proselytize (attempt to convert) other citizens to their religion as long as such attempts are done in a non-coercive, peaceful manner. A score of 0 indicates that the government restricted some religious practices, while a score 1 indicates that the government placed no restrictions on religious practices in a year. [**NOTE: Starting with the 2007 coding, this variable was retired.] **

**[WORKER] Worker’s Rights **Workers should have freedom of association at their workplaces and the right to bargain collectively with their employers. This variable indicates the extent to which workers enjoy these and other internationally recognized rights at work, including a prohibition on the use of any form of forced or compulsory labor; a minimum age for the employment of children; and acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. A score of 0 indicates that workers’ rights were severely restricted; a score of 1 indicates that workers’ rights were somewhat restricted; and a score of 2 indicates that workers’ rights were fully protected during the year in question.

A score of 2 indicates that women had some social rights under law, and the government effectively enforced these rights in practice while still allowing a low level of discrimination against women in social matters. Finally, a score of 3 indicates that all or nearly all of women’s social rights were guaranteed by law and the government fully and vigorously enforced these laws in practice. **[This variable was retired as of 2005.] **

**[INJUD] Independence of the Judiciary **This variable indicates the extent to which the judiciary is independent of control from other sources, such as another branch of the government or the military. A score of 0 indicates “not independent”, a score of 1 indicates “partially independent” and a score of 2 indicates “generally independent”.

**ADDITIONAL CODES TO BE EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSIS **

Sometimes, special circumstances in a country make it so that a CIRI value cannot be given. Such instances receive one of the following special codes developed by the POLITY data project and outlined in Marshall and Jaggers (2003). Be sure to remove these values from your dataset, or use software to exclude them from analysis, before engaging in a statistical analysis using the CIRI data.

**-999 **CIRI uses the code -999 where data are missing.

**-77 **A score of "-77" indicates periods of interregnum, during which there is a complete collapse of central political authority.

**-66 **A score of "-66" indicates a period of interruption. If a country is occupied by foreign powers during wartime, terminating the old polity, then reestablishes the pre-war polity after the occupation ends, the intervening years are coded as an interruption. 

For a full discussion of the POLITY indicators of special circumstance see Marshall and Jaggers (2003).
